Bankruptcy Law ?

1. Introduction, Evolution and Modern Objectives
January 22, 2018
-	Corporations can enter bankruptcy proceedings to liquidate all assets and then cease to exist or enter into restructuring ? Restructuring can be anything (e.g. merging entities, renegotiating its pension pan, etc.) – protected from all of its creditors during this time
?	Restructuring means trying to become a viable financial entity, not getting rid of all of its debt
?	Restructuring is not usually successful

Parties
-	“Creditors”: Individuals or companies who are owed $
?	Creditors may include: Bank, landlord, credit card companies, utilities, phone and cable providers, family members, gov’t (taxes, municipal taxes, income taxes), secured creditors, unsecured creditors, employees, unpaid suppliers, etc.
-	“Debtor”: Those who owe the $ to the creditors

Issues
A. Bankruptcy vs. Restructuring
-	Bankruptcy (Trustee in bankruptcy, liquidation of assets in accordance w/ a priority scheme)
?	As a company, you cease to exist
?	As debtor (individual), there is bankruptcy discharge imposed ? Discharged from making further payments
-	If you try to restructure, it is costly (they need financing to fund the efforts)
?	Problematic: Person that is by definition unable to pay their obligations as they come due 
?	Things you may want:
1.	Highest priority possible for payout (super priority) –either on liquidation or paying out after the restructuring
2.	Change in directorship
3.	Higher interest rate
4.	Requiring more financial information to allow you to structure your affairs to protect yourself if the company is going under

B. Vulnerable Creditors (e.g., employees, pensioners) 
-	Their livelihood is dependent on the company and they have no control over it 
-	An employee cannot protect itself, unlike a shareholder (shareholder may diversity their portfolio) 
-	An employee (and a pensioner) are both limited to the one company 
-	Lack of information to know that the company is facing financial difficulties
-	This is contrasted to a lender, who may be able to obtain that information
-	They are up against DIP lenders (large financial companies), but this is required to finance the structuring (can only succeed by borrowing $) ? Therefore, a higher priority must be given to these financing companies in order to facilitate the borrowing

C. Actions of the Company
-	Upon bankruptcy, there is a date of bankruptcy
-	Upon appointment of receiver/trustee, they will examine all of the payments and sales of assets to determine whether they are questionable 
?	Looking at the transaction, determining whether there is an issue w/ these (fraud: conveys an intent to move assets away from a creditor)
?	E.g. Transferring assets to a spouse, out of the reach of the creditor
?	Bring them back to the bankrupt’s estate, which vests to the trustee in bankruptcy
?	The trustee has wide ranging powers to reserve such transactions ? If the transactions are reversed, the $/asset is transferred back to the estate and will vest to the trustee
?	The date to which the trustee can reach back is dependent on whom it is transferred to (e.g. mom (1 year) or arm’s length (3 months))
-	NOTE: B/c we are dealing w/ fraud, there are fraud provisions in the CC

D. Creditors Who are Holding Tickets (Ticketholders)
-	DO not get refund – they are unsecured creditors
-	Could argue a trust, in which it would not vest in the trustee – it would be given to the beneficiary of the trust ? In order to find a trust, you must find that the parties intended to form at rust
-	Otherwise, you may argue that a constructive trust arose by common law 
?	Deemed trusts under provincial legislation: b/c BIA is a federal piece of legislation, under the doctrine of paramountcy, the BIA applies
-	There is NEVER enough to go around, which means bankruptcy is about choice ? This also means that there will always be a winner and always a loser 

Terminology
-	“Liquidation”: Collecting assets to sell and taking the proceeds to distribute them
?	Converting something into cash
?	The individual/company is the bankrupt
-	“Reorganization”: Avoids liquidation at the beginning
?	Enables the company to come to an arrangement w/ its creditors
?	NOTE: It is possible under the CCAA ($5M debt + threshold for application) or the BIA
?	The goal is to emerge as a viable company
?	BIA is very rules driven: very rigid, whereas the CCAA provides greater flexibility
?	Individual: “Consumer proposal” (Coming to an agreement w/ creditors to hopefully emerge from debt and allow you to continue in your life without having to declare bankruptcy)
-	“Insolvency”: Factual state of not being able to pay your debts as they come due
-	“Bankruptcy”: Debts and liabilities as they come due, in which there is a legal mechanism to satisfy collectively all of the claims on the assets (done broadly through liquidation or reorganization) [Legal status: Recognized legally as a bankrupt]
?	Trustee in Bankruptcy is whom all of the debtor’s/bankrupt’s assets vest ? He represents all the unsecured creditors (The secured creditors do not need protection)
?	Discharge will remove the obligation to pay the loan (With exceptions – e.g., student loans)
?	A company that declare bankruptcy and finishes bankruptcy proceedings will cease to exist
-	Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA)
-	Companies Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA)


January 24, 2018
1. The Evolution of Bankruptcy Law
-	Debate regarding bankruptcy goes back to 3 people ? Thomas Jackson, David Baird have one view and Elizabeth Warren has another view on what it should be about
-	Bankruptcy law is really comprehensive, very detailed
-	Aimed at debtor rehabilitation and aimed at helping honest, but unfortunate debtors ? “Fresh start”
?	Hasn’t always been like this
?	Bankrupts were typically viewed as criminals ? Seen as dishonest, irresponsible and careless
?	A lot of reference to prison in bankruptcy law
?	It was always creditor petitioned ? No ability for debtor to do it himself
?	Sometimes imprisoned until he gave up possession of all his assets
-	This concept of the honest but unfortunate debtor and giving the debtor a fresh start, it manifests in our laws and the laws are different amongst provinces
?	Provinces have different exemptions
?	But the purpose of exemptions is to give the debtor a chance to restart their life
-	It’s a public policy thing ? If you have bankrupts who are unable to pick themselves up, it’s simply adding more pressure to social services so it’s in the public interest that people have something to be able to start their lives again after declaring bankruptcy
?	The whole point of bankruptcy before was to make sure that we got his or her property for the benefit of creditors
?	The regime has never been pro-debtor
?	Never to facilitate reorganization (to get back on track) or discharge (means that upon the debtor going through the period of bankruptcy and liquidating assets, there is a discharge which means creditors can no longer pursue the debtor upon discharge)

England
-	1542 Bankruptcy Act (England)
?	Pro rata basis ? Doesn’t matter what you’re owed from the debtor, the trustee will look at all the assets and determine how much each creditor gets
-	1573 Statute of Elizabeth
?	Directed at fraudulent debtors
?	Always the notion that debtor has done something wrong and this notion has continued on after this as well
?	Two changes: Limited statutes to traders and created list of acts of bankruptcy (things a debtor would have done that would constitute a creditor to push for bankruptcy)
-	Do criminal origins affect the way we think about bankruptcy? ? B/c this isn’t entirely gone
-	1623 Enactment: Pillory and loss of ear could be imposed upon debtor
-	1705 Statute of Anne 
?	Had the discharge created ? Had nothing to do with pro-debtor attitudes
?	The reasoning in introducing discharge was to provide incentives for debtors to cooperate w/ the creditors
?	Had nothing to do w/ the fresh start
-	1883 ? Debtors given right to make assignments in England

Canada
-	Insolvent Act 1869
?	Involuntary and voluntary proceeding
?	Our act only applied to traders
?	Contained discharge but required consent of creditors before it was imposed on the debtor 
-	1875: Parliament got rid of voluntary proceedings
-	1880: Parliament repeals Insolvent Act
?	No bankruptcy law in Canada b/w 1880 and 1919
?	Bankruptcy law comes with a discharge, comes with the ability for the debtor to deal with creditors and not pay the full amount ? SO when first introduced, creditors did not like bankruptcy law
?	Such a negative reaction to having bankruptcy law so they completely got rid of it so creditors could continue to pursue until they paid them off entirely
?	But there was a lot of pressure on Parliament to re-enact bankruptcy law
?	What happened was Parliament wasn’t acting so provinces started to act and started to deal w/ this area of law but this was challenged in 1884 b/c it’s ultra vires
?	What Provinces did then started then was enact statutes that were within their jurisdiction ? All of these statutes were to deal w/ debtors who were transferring property 
?	A debtor that is facing bankruptcy or unable to pay their debts can do one of two things: 1) Take assets that she has and convey it to someone who is close to her w/ the intention to get that property back when the creditors stopped coming after her (fraudulent conveyance); 2) If there are a lot of creditors, that person may be inclined to pay one creditor but not the others (this is also contrary to statute) 
?	The Provinces started enacting fraudulent preferences acts and fraudulent conveyances acts
?	Do rely on Statute of Elizabeth from 1571 for fraudulent conveyances (We don’t have our own act)
?	Fraudulent preferences act we have 
?	This is outside the bankruptcy regime 
?	Never a repeal ? So you have bits and pieces of laws over centuries as well as the bankruptcy act that comes in affects this area so it is quite messy
-	1933: CCAA enacted b/c of the state of the country (great depression) at that time but nobody used it until 1980 ? When Parliament added 5 million dollar jurisdiction to it 
-	1949 Act: No reorganization regime 
-	1992: Parliament enacted reorganization provisions of BIA
-	1997: Encouraged debtors to make consumer proposals (debtor coming up w/ proposal for all his creditors and saying would this work for you? If I go into bankruptcy, you won’t get anything so how about we work something out?)
-	Many amendments over the years 
?	5-6 years ago, there were tons of amendments 
?	Now, we have had a lot of recent amendments and we’re at a better state than before
-	Important Reports ? Explain a lot of what was in existence at the time and what Parliament wanted to do ? What law was at the time and potential changes we may want to consider 
?	Tasse Report 1970
?	Colter Report 1986
-	Post 1997 Changes
?	Bill C 55 & 62 very important 
?	There was a committee that was formed as a result of what was happening and all of the problems that were resulting from Bill C 55
-	The area of bankruptcy has been in a state of flux for a long time
-	As it is now, we come to the point of BIA being federal (s.91(21) of CA, 1867) ? Federal gov’t has full jurisdiction over “bankruptcy and insolvency” while provincial gov’t has jurisdiction over “property and civil rights” so they get to exempt property from bankruptcy but as bankruptcy goes, it is the federal gov’t that deal with this
-	Sam Levy ** Case not in casebook
?	The purpose of the Bankruptcy Act is to protect the debtor, his or her creditors and the public interest ? Not a creditor focused statute
?	The more a society promotes credit and therefore debt, the more the legislation will tend to give priority to alleviating the lot of honest and hapless debtors
?	A scheme based on debt must include a self-regulating system so that defaulting debtors may eventually be reintegrated into the system and become productive elements once again
?	The implementation of these public policies might be expected to take priority over private "choice of forum" agreements where the two come into conflict
?	[P]rivate contractual arrangements between parties cannot prevail over the exercise of bankruptcy jurisdiction, which belongs to the realm of public policy, serving a wider spread of interests including, ultimately, those of society at large (Fletcher, Insolvency in Private International Law)
-	Everyone is stayed and it is a collective scheme that comes into effect and nobody gets to start proceedings against the debtor and nobody gets to finish ? The debtor is off limits and it’s the trustee that deals w/ the debtor and all the creditors 
-	So when we have pre-bankruptcy and post-bankruptcy, it’s very different in terms of the priority scheme and what can happen in regard to the debtor
-	You have be pro-debtor AND pro-creditor

Warren vs Baird/Jackson
-	They both generally agree on what the purpose of bankruptcy is
-	Purpose of Bankruptcy
?	To contribute to the aggregate pie, reduces the individual cost for creditors, supplements/fixes anything that needs fixing at the state level and protects debtors to take proceedings out of their hands and allows   trustees to deal with things, gives them a fresh start
?	Compulsory regime that is imposed on creditors ? Jackson says once you set aside the debtor, and you look at creditors, bankruptcy law is primarily procedural so all it does is it alters the procedure from before bankruptcy to after bankruptcy 
?	He also says there is a cost to creditors that is helped in the bankruptcy system
-	What is debtor/creditor law (state law) ? It’s how you would collect your debts if there was no bankruptcy
?	As an unsecured creditor (which most creditors are), you have to sue the debtor and that could take very long & even if you get a judgment you have to work to enforce that judgment
?	This is a long process
?	Unsecured creditor is a creditor who doesn’t have a security interest (not able to seize collateral) ? Only has contractual relationship w/ debtor and so only has contractual interest which involves suing
?	Secured creditor has proprietary interest 
-	What happens if we only have debtor/creditor law?
?	For creditors, it comes a race (first come, first serve) “grab law” ? Creditors that may be alerted is going to gain the most from “grab law” (i.e. through monitoring)
?	Bankruptcy does not actually alter the priority of secured creditors for the most part (They’re usually first but there are times when some creditors have super priority)
?	Secured creditors have more information available to them
?	On the other hand, vulnerable creditors (e.g. pensioners, workers) are not going to have that information available to them
?	The system outside of bankruptcy supports creditors self interest ? Does not support creditors working collectively and this is fine as long as debtor is solvent but if the debtor is insolvent, there is a problem
-	“Common pool” problem
?	Finite amount of resources & if there’s more than one creditor, unless you work collectively, you’re going to run into a problem
?	If you’re one person you know how many assets are available so you can regulate your behaviour in a way to maximize those assets; but if there’s more than one person, and there are limited assets, each person may act in their own self interest
?	If there are other creditors, you’re going to sue the debtor and try to get that first judgment ? Getting rid of any potential for that debtor to fix things on her own (This is a problem)
?	The problem is that there’s no regulation ? When a debtor is insolvent, you need this sort of regulation
?	This regulation is where bankruptcy enters the picture
?	Bankruptcy comes in when the debtor cannot meet all of the demands that are on him and needs someone to regulate all the creditors that will come knocking down on his door
?	Make these individuals to act as one ? Collective proceeding
-	Advantages of Bankruptcy
?	Collective system ? Replenishes the pool, in a way, by limiting what the creditors can do
?	What a liquidation does is it liquidates the assets and turns them into cash ? You can do that in a bankruptcy but one of the things that can happen in a bankruptcy or a reorganization b/c some of the assets are kept together and sold together
?	This is a good thing as the assets collectively are worth more as a whole than when they are liquidated individually
?	Bankruptcy forces creditors to work together in a collective proceeding
?	When you have one person, the trustee, dealing with the assets as whole, you’re going to have more in the end rather than having a fire sale
?	For some individual creditors, bankruptcy is not the best way to go but as a collection of creditors ( as a whole), bankruptcy benefits the group
?	A collective system gets rid of the individual costs b/c creditors have individual costs not only of rushing first to the courthouse to sue the debtor but if you need to make sure you can get to the courthouse first, you’re going to spend a lot of $ monitoring that debtor ? If you know there’s a bankruptcy system that is imposed, these costs can be avoided
?	Just b/c you start a law suit, doesn’t mean you’re in a better place in a bankruptcy (unless the suit has been finished with a judgment issued and $ has been given out)
?	If you have that judgment but you haven’t done anything to enforce that, you just have what’s owed to you but can’t do anything with that
-	When should bankruptcy be triggered?
?	Jackson tells us that the process of bankruptcy must only be triggered when doing so is in the best interest of the group
?	It’s not going to be in the best interest of the group when it’s triggered by someone who stands to gain substantive rights outside the bankruptcy (things they would have gotten if there was no bankruptcy)
?	People should not be getting substantive rights out of bankruptcy 
?	Warren thinks debtor/creditor law should not be the same pre and post bankruptcy
?	She says there is a very distinct purpose for state law and distinct purpose for bankruptcy law
?	State law is designed to deal w/ a single default (debtor defaults to one or maybe two creditors)
?	Bankruptcy law is designed to deal w/ the debtor’s imminent collapse ? Defaulting to everybody (This makes sense b/c bankruptcy only happens during insolvency)
?	Much more collective group perspective rather than an individual default perspective 
?	We need to have something different in bankruptcy law to deal with entitlements
?	She does list a few different creditors that would be affected: 1) landlords (unsecured but stuck in bankruptcy b/c landlord can’t just kick somebody out; they have to give notice, by law will incur more $ owed to him so a landlord is going to have a lot of debt at the end – should that landlord not be given preferred status?), 2) employees 

1.1 Introduction (Pg. 3-7)
Introduction, Evolution, and Modern Objectives
-	Under the BIA, the terms “bankruptcy” and “bankrupt” are confined to straight liquidation proceedings under Part III of the Act and a “bankrupt” is the subject of a “bankruptcy order” ? All other proceedings under the BIA are known as insolvency proceedings or are identified by the part and divisions of the BIA under which the proceedings are brought
-	The subject of these proceedings is referred to as a “debtor” 
-	The BIA draws no distinction b/w corporate and personal or individual bankruptcies ? All liquidation bankruptcies are basically governed by the same rules 
-	The term “reorganization” is not actually used in the BIA or the CCAA to describe non-liquidation proceedings designed to enable an insolvent business to stay alive or to enable an insolvent individual to avoid the stigma of bankruptcy by reaching agreement w/ the debtor’s creditors to pay off all or part of the indebtedness over a period of years ? Instead, BIA III.I and III.II speak respectively of commercial and consumer proposals; the object of proceedings under the CCAA is referred to as an “arrangement” 
?	However, “reorganization” (or “reconstructuring”) are the non-technical terms frequently used to describe proceedings under BIA III.I and the CCAA
-	“Insolvencies” cover bankruptcy and reorganizational proceedings under the BIA (but not proceedings under the CCAA)
-	Business insolvencies cover the insolvencies of corporations, partnerships, and individuals where, in the case of individuals, 50% or more of the indebtedness is of business origin
-	Personal insolvencies cover business and consumer insolvencies, whereas consumer insolvencies are restricted to personal, non-business insolvencies
?	Consumer insolvencies are subdivided into consumer bankruptcy proceedings and consumer proposals under BIA III.II

1.2 Evolution of Bankruptcy Law (Pg. 7-27)
Bankruptcy and Insolvency: Report of the Study Committee on Bankruptcy and Insolvency Legislation
-	Little attempt was made to integrate new legislation w/ the existing legislation or to make a single comprehensive Act ? The result has been a multiplicity of statutes and systems which often lead to inequity and inefficiency
-	W/ the multiplicity of systems, the debtor and the creditor sometimes have the choice of the system under which to proceed and, under certain circumstances, they can fare better under one system than another 
?	Many corporations may be liquidated under either the Winding Up Act or the Bankruptcy Act ? There are transactions that may be set aside as fraudulent preferences under one of these Acts, which could not be set aside, as such, under the other 
?	However, since the 1966 amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, the Winding Up Act does not apply to a corporation, where a petition is filed under the Bankruptcy Act
?	While opportunity of a debtor or a creditor to elect to take proceedings under the Winding up Act, and thus forestall proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act, has been reduced, inequities are still possible 
?	There are situations, however, where no choice is given to the debtor or the creditors as to which statute may be used (E.g. A # of statutes apply in whole or part, for e.g., to particular debtors, such as such as banks, insurance companies and railways) ? This situation may also lead to inequity as both debtor and creditors, under the particular statutes, may, w/o good reason, fare differently than those who come within the provisions of other statutes
-	In spite of the multiplicity of system sand statutes, there are a # of debtors whose affairs cannot be liquidated under existing federal legislation
?	E.g. Non-trading corporations
?	Not clear whether any of this legislation applies to the winding-up, by reason of their insolvency, of some corporations, such as provincial trust companies and certain building societies
-	Existing legislation may also be criticized for being, to a considerable degree, either rudimentary or out-dated ? Much of it designed when social & commercial conditions were very much different than what they are today

1.4 Modern Bankruptcy Objectives (Pg. 27-54)
-	In common law jurisdictions, it is now well established that bankruptcy law serves 3 principal functions:
1.	To solve the “collective action problem” discouraging creditors from collaborating outside bankruptcy and to provide a mechanism in bankruptcy legislation for the orderly liquidation of a bankrupt’s estate and distribution of the proceeds among the creditors
2.	To enable basically viable enterprises to reorganize themselves to enable them to stay in business
3.	To enable overextended debtors to make a “fresh start” by surrendering their non-exempt assets and obtaining a discharge for the balance of their debts

Thomas H Jackson, The Logic and Limits of Bankruptcy Law
1. The Role of Bankruptcy Law and Collective Action in Debt Collection
-	Bankruptcy is a response to credit ? The essence of credit economies is people and firms – that can be called debtors – borrowing $
?	The reasons for this are varied
?	Just as the reasons for borrowing are varied, so, too, are the methods 
-	Whatever the reasons for lending and whatever its form, the terms on which consensual credit is extended depend to a substantial extent on the likelihood of voluntary repayment and on the means for coercing repayment
-	Creditor remedies outside of bankruptcy can be accurately described as a species of “grab law”, represented by the key characteristic of first-come, first-served
-	When the issue is credit, the ways that one can stake a place in line are varied 
?	Some involve “voluntary” actions of the debtor
?	In other cases creditor’s place in line is established notwithstanding the lack of debtor’s consent ? Although the methods for establishing a place in line are varied, the fundamental ordering principle is the same 
?	Creditors are paid according to their place in line for particular assets
?	With a few exceptions, moreover, one’s place in line is fixed by the time when one acquires an interest in the assets and takes the appropriate steps to publicize it
-	The question at the core of bankruptcy law is whether a better ordering system can be devised that would be worth the inevitable costs associated w/ implementing a new system
-	The basic problem that bankruptcy law is designed to handle, both as a normative matter and as a positive matter, is that the system of individual creditor remedies may be bad for the creditors as a group when there are not enough assets to go around 
-	Because creditors have conflicting rights, there is a tendency in their debt-collection efforts to make a bad situation worse ? Bankruptcy law responds to this problem
-	Bankruptcy’s advantages:
?	To make sure that creditors, in pursuing their individual remedies, do not actually decrease the aggregate value of the assets that will be used to repay them
?	Better chance of getting some $$ rather than using the all or nothing method
?	There may be costs to the individualized approach to collecting
-	The single most fruitful way to think about bankruptcy is to see it as ameliorating a common pool problem created by a system of individual creditor remedies ? Bankruptcy provides a way to override the creditors’ pursuit of their own remedies and to make them work together
-	This approach immediately suggests several features of bankruptcy law:
?	First, such a law must usurp individual creditor remedies in order to make the claimants act in an altruistic and cooperative way ? Thus, the proceeding is inherently collective
?	Moreover, this system only works only if all the creditors are bound to it ? To allow a debtor to contract w/ a creditor to avoid participating in the bankruptcy proceeding would destroy the advantages of a collective system 
?	So the proceeding must be compulsory as well
-	Presence of a bankruptcy system does not mandate its use whenever there is a common pool problem ? Bankruptcy law stipulates a minimum set of entitlements for claimants 
?	That, in turn, permits them to “bargain in the shadow of the law” and to implement a consensual collective proceeding outside of the bankruptcy process 
?	B/c use of bankruptcy process has costs of its own, if creditors can consensually gain the sort of advantages of acting collectively that bankruptcy brings, they could avoid those costs
?	Accordingly, one would expect that consensual deals among creditors outside the bankruptcy process would often be attempted first
?	The formal bankruptcy process would presumably be used only when individual advantage-taking in the setting of multiparty negotiations made a consensual deal too costly to strike – which, may however, occur frequently as the # of creditors increases 
-	It is possible that the rules specifying when a bankruptcy petition may be filed prevent the commencement of a collective proceeding until its too late to save the debtor’s assets from the self-interested actions of various creditors
-	Another possibility, however, is that the collective proceeding will begin too soon ? Forcing all the creditors to refrain from individual actions brings its own costs
-	To say that a common pool problem exists is not to say that individual behaviour is entirely self-interested or that legal rules can solve all collective answer problems ? Nor can we be confident that the bankruptcy rules themselves do not create problems
-	Sufficient to ask whether there is in fact a common pool problem that cannot be solved by creditors contracting among themselves 
?	If # if creditors is sufficiently small and sufficiently determinate, it may be possible for them to negotiate a solution at the time of insolvency that would avoid many, if not most, of the costs of an individual remedies system, even if they were not bargaining in the shadow of the law
?	But in cases in which there are large #s of creditors or the creditors are not immediately known at a particular time, the ability of the creditors to solve the problem of an individual remedies system by an actual agreement may be lost
-	Bankruptcy provides the desired result by making available a collective system after insolvency has occurred 

2. Determining Liabilities and the Basic Role of Non-bankruptcy Law
-	Bankruptcy provides a collective forum of sorting out rights of “owners” and can be justified b/c it provides protection against the destructive effects of an individual remedies system when there are not enough assets to go around ? This makes the basic process one of determining who gets what, in what order 
?	Who is fundamentally a question of claims, or what shall often be referred to as liabilities
?	What is fundamentally a question of property of the estate, or what shall often be referred to as assets
-	What bankruptcy should be doing, in the abstract, is asking how much someone would pay for the assets of a debtor, assuming they could be sole free of liabilities ? The resulting $ is then taken and distributed to the holders of the liabilities according to their nonbankruptcy entitlements

The Destructive Effect of Changes of Relative Entitlements in Bankruptcy
-	In its role as a collective debt-collection device, bankruptcy law should not create rights ? Instead, it should act to ensure that the rights that exist are vindicated to the extent possible 
-	Only in this way can bankruptcy law minimize the conversion costs of transferring an insolvent debtor’s assets to its creditors
-	Bankruptcy law is best approached by separating these two questions – the question of how the process can maximize the value of a given pool of assets and the question of how the law should allocate entitlements to whatever pool exists – and limiting bankruptcy law to the first 

Elizabeth Warren, “Bankruptcy Policy”
•	What function does bankruptcy serve?
•	Thesis: Bankruptcy is an attempt to deal w/ a debtor’s multiple defaults and distribute the consequences among creditors – encompasses often competing values – no one value dominates, but many are considered when deciding ‘how shall the losses be distributed?’
•	[Contrasting view: goal of bankruptcy is to be measured only by whether or not it enhances creditors collective benefits.] 
•	Bankruptcy is only a collection scheme – it depends on other legal rules for the determination of substantive rights underlying bankruptcy claims (presupposes the enforceability of an underlying claim). 
•	Two types of default:
o	Single default: only one creditor complains about repayment and the remaining creditors are content with their repayment prospects
o	Widespread default: collapse in which every creditor’s prospects for repayment are sharply diminished.
•	Bankruptcy begins w/ a presumption of default on every obligation the debtor owes (widespread) (and that some creditors won’t be paid in full). 
o	Goals of bankruptcy law:
?	 aims first to conserve and divide an estate that can’t meet all its obligations and 
?	second to terminate rights of unpaid creditors. 
•	-Can be thought of as “creditor vs. creditor” law – w/ competing creditors struggling to push the losses of default onto others. 
•	-Priority payment to one creditor necessarily leaves less for remaining characters – distributional issues. 
•	What about future claimants? Bankruptcy code rejects leaving future claimants uncompensated. USA bankruptcy code defines “claim” broadly to pull future creditors into the debtor’s distribution plan and to require participation by anticipated claimants. 
•	Reorganization also serves dist. interests of many who aren’t technically creditors (e.g. employees of company who would lose their jobs, neighbouring properties whose values would go down if the building went vacant, customers who would have to shop farther away, cities who would lose tax revenue ect.) but have interest in business’ continued existence. 
•	Even if there were no legal scheme (like bankruptcy) to distribute the costs of default, the losses would always be distributed by some method e.g. creditor speed, creditor strength or debtor favoritism. The point is that it is not bankruptcy that causes some creditors not to get paid while others do, it is the default itself that causes the loss. Bankruptcy is simply the method of distributing the loss resulting from the default. 
•	[Contrast this w/ Baird’s view: single justification for bankruptcy: enhancing collective return for creditors who have identified property rights].  Baird acknowledges neither the potential benefit of a second chance for a business nor the possibility that bankruptcy policy might aim towards a broad balance between the competing interests of the debtor, the creditors, and the many others who may be injured by the debtor’s collapse. 

Douglas G Baird, “Loss Distribution, Forum Shopping, and Bankruptcy: A Reply to Warren”
•	Baird believes that bankruptcy’s only legitimate function (using bankruptcy in the broader US sense) is to resolve the collective-action problem existing outside bankruptcy, and that other goals must be eschewed. In particular they say that pre-bankruptcy rights should not be changed in bankruptcy because this distorts bankruptcy’s goals. 
•	Baird disagrees with the traditional view of bankruptcy policy.
•	Traditional bankruptcy policy relies on assumptions:
i.	Bankruptcy law has a special role to play in determining how losses from a business failure should be borne,
ii.	Creditors may sometimes be required to give up some of their ultimate rights to the assets of the firm so that the firm will have a better chance of surviving, 
iii.	Entrusting a bankruptcy judge with equitable discretion is a useful and unobjectionable way to balance the conflicting and competing interests of the parties, and
iv.	Creditors in bankruptcy have no cause to complain when they lose some rights they had outside of bankruptcy, because bankruptcy is an entirely new game that deals with different kinds of problems.

(2) All courts and the officers of all courts shall severally act in aid of and be auxiliary to each other in all matters of bankruptcy, and an order of one court seeking aid, w/ a request to another court, shall be deemed sufficient to enable the latter court to exercise, in regard to the matters directed by the order, such jurisdiction as either the court that made the request or the court to which the request is made could exercise in regard to similar matters within its jurisdiction

(3) Any warrant of a court may be enforced in any part of Canada in the same manner and subject to the same privileges as a warrant issued by a justice of the peace under or in pursuance of the Criminal Code may be executed against a person charged w/ an indictable offence

Review
-	Should bankruptcy law reflect the pre-bankruptcy scheme? Why or why not?
?	Jackson ? The process of bankruptcy must only be triggered when it is in the best interest of the group and Warren critiques this
-	State law or debtor creditor law is to deal with a single default 
-	Bankruptcy law concentrates on default on a much broader basis ? Begins w/ the presumption that there will be a default on every obligation the debtor has 
?	Bankruptcy can only be triggered when there’s insolvency (inability to pay debt as they become due)
-	For bankruptcy, we have to focus our dispute on who is entitled to share and how should the assets be divided 
-	If we simply rely on non-bankruptcy law, we are relying on a system f law that was designed for different purposes ? Designed to address a default b/w the debtor and creditor 
-	Warren is open to the creation of new rights in bankruptcy ? She says we should have new rights in bankruptcy and she’s concerned w/ how assets are distributed in bankruptcy
?	Bankruptcy is not debtor vs. creditor ? Bankruptcy is creditor vs. creditor – it’s not the debtor anymore and not really involved in bankruptcy law
?	Warren critiques Baird for saying that we should use state law as a distributions scheme in bankruptcy
?	If we have the exact same distribution scheme, there is no incentive for a creditor to trigger bankruptcy 
-	Is it open to parliament to create new rights? Or should we defer to the pre-bankruptcy distribution scheme?
-	When you have a lot of creditors, everyone seeks to gain something outside of bankruptcy and inside of bankruptcy as well ? It might be the case that some creditors will have the bankruptcy scheme applying and might decide to trigger it if it’s in their best interests but not in everybody else’s
-	If you have a debtor who is solvent, the debtor can pay anyone they want ? If you’re not getting paid, you can sue
?	If debtor is not able to pay in general and a creditor does get paid, and the debtor subsequently goes into bankruptcy, that’s preference law 
?	Once the trustee comes in, it will become a pre-bankruptcy reviewable transaction and trustee can review this payment
-	There’s a big power imbalance b/w the different types of creditors (small creditors are the mercy of the bankrupt and don’t have the power to gain info until it’s too late)
?	We have market failures that happen to certain creditors 
-	So as a result of all of this, to have a pure Jacksonian model is to accept that if you are at a big disadvantage, we are not going to help you at all (not accepting public policy aspect) 
?	And we’ve decided not to do this and now we have special exceptions
?	ASK: Is this really a protection for this creditor or are there too many technicalities for the creditor to fit into the requirements? 
-	Another aspect, which is about the debtor, is that we have certain property exceptions 
?	Property law is under provincial jurisdiction so exemptions vary b/w the provinces
?	E.g. Alberta being a western province, wanted to incentivize people to come out from Quebec and Ontario so has exemptions that are quite generous 
?	Bankruptcy law recognizes these exemptions
?	Should we have a federal exemption list? Is it unfair to have different exemptions? Nothing has been done but there has been some talk regarding this

Outline of Canada’s Bankruptcy System
-	What is the distinction b/w bankruptcy and other proceedings? 
-	Clear line b/w bankruptcy and insolvency and there are two characteristics of a true bankruptcy scheme:
1.	Collection and sale of bankrupt’s non-exempt assets an distribution of proceeds among creditors; and
2.	Discharge of the bankrupt from most of its debts 
-	It is a pari passu distribution system = equal rate
-	The trustee is the one that has enforcement and acts on behalf of all the creditors, with the result that individual enforcement is not necessary
?	Secured ? Preferred (Something vulnerable about them so got this status by virtue of law) ? Unsecured
-	Discharge of provable debts by the debtor and is a system that can be invoked both by the debtor and by the creditors 
-	It’s a federal system and everyone is subject to the bankruptcy code
-	Once it is invoked by a creditor, the system cannot be terminated w/o a special permission of a sitting court of bankruptcy
-	What is the difference b/w having a debtor declaring bankruptcy and the debtor being sued?
?	Debtor/creditor law: Individual enforcement – Creditor sues and enforces judgment against debtor
?	Once a judgment is in place, the creditor then has a judgment and can go about enforcing that judgment against the debtor
?	Bankruptcy: Collective regime, no individual enforcement
?	Has the ability for the debtor to obtain discharge (not possible under provincial law)
-	Terms
?	Liquidation – Asset are sold off and proceeds are distributed to the creditors; individual receives discharge
?	Reorganization – Plan w/ creditors to come to a compromise (Can happen under BIA or CCAA)
?	Debtor taking shelter in the court
?	Coming to a comprise w/ the creditors and the court acts as a liaison 
?	Insolvency – Defined under the BIA; Simply means you can’t pay your debts as they become due
?	Insolvent person under the BIA is someone who is NOT bankrupt (s.2), who carries on business, resides or has property in Canada, whose liabilities to creditors amounts to $1,000
?	$1,000 is also how much it takes for someone to petition you into bankruptcy 
?	Insolvent person who, for any reason, is able to meet their obligations as they become due and has ceased to pay such obligations OR even if you sell all property, you’re still not able to pay off debt
?	Bankruptcy ? Formal proceeding; a formal change in legal status
?	Bankrupt ? We are talking about a legal status (no longer factual)
?	Insolvency and bankruptcy
?	Debtor ? Bankrupt
?	Insolvency can lead to 3 things:
1.	Debtor/company trades out of insolvent state;
2.	Debtor/company becomes bankrupt ? A lot of companies exist at an insolvent state and if they are not able to get out of that state, most obvious is the bankruptcy route
3.	Debtor/company makes proposal or offers compromise to creditors (reorganization) ? Even if there is a promise, it is not a guarantee and you can still become bankrupt 
-	Administrative Players
?	Superintendent of Bankruptcy – not a person but is an office (federal office and it is the centre of the administrative structure of the bankruptcy system)
?	Investigatory powers
?	Licensing of trustees
?	Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy: OSB
?	Official Receiver (OR) ? In Canada, each province is a bankruptcy district; so the trustee’s conduct in a district is managed by the superintendent; OR is not a receiver in a sense of going into the debtor’s business and occupying a role, it is administrative (Trustees appoint to OR)
?	Represents superintendent in each bankruptcy district
?	Examine debtor w/ respect to transactions they have made in the course of their business
?	Trustee in Bankruptcy ? In charge of the bankruptcy proceeding 
?	Individual or corp. licensed by Superintendent to carry on bankruptcy administration of liquidating debtor’s assets and distributing to creditors
?	Duties and powers: ss.16, 17, 30 BIA
?	E.g. Some counselling that debtor may go through (sometime this is required before discharge)
?	Usually chartered accountants and most are accounting firms
?	Representative of unsecured creditors
?	If the creditors don’t like a trustee, they can vote to replace that person
?	You can apply to have a trustee removed if you wish, if you’re an interested party
?	Trustee is often involved in litigation: 1) Review debtors affairs and see what kind of affairs the debtor entered into before bankruptcy ? They have the power to unwind the transaction and bring it back into the estate (Trustee is the representative unsecured creditors so it is beneficial to have more $ in the estate); 2) Litigation w/ secured creditors (They might go against each other, again to bring more asset into the estate)
?	Inspectors
?	Appointed by creditors: ss.116, 199
?	Registrar: Powers: s.192
?	Court: s.183 ? Just QB but the term ‘bankruptcy court’ is sometimes used; ‘commercial court’ – chief justice just designating certain justices to hear commercial matters (in Toronto)
?	Debtor: Individual or corporation
?	Creditor: Secured, unsecured, preferred (s.136)
?	Person that has a claim that is secured, unsecured or preferred
?	No preferred creditor outside of bankruptcy – only comes into existence once bankruptcy happens
?	A secured creditor is a person who holds a charge against the debtor’s assets; can also have a propriety interest in all of the debtor’s assets
?	All have contract but SC’s contract takes one step further and has a proprietary interest so upon default, the SC can go into the debtor’s place of business and takes the asset the creditor has a security interest in
?	An USC has to SUE the debtor; this is the major difference b/w SC and USC
?	Contractual (USC) vs. proprietary right (SC)
?	A SCs are not subject to a stay – during the bankruptcy stay they can still come in and take the asset that is subject to their security interest
?	USC is subject to the stay – the trustee is the representative and these are the judgment creditors = unsecured creditors that have obtained a judgment against the debtor ? Holding that judgment still doesn’t have rights except to enforce that judgment
?	Can do various things – but all of them take time and $
?	Preferred creditors are unsecured but by virtue of the Bankruptcy Act are given preferred status

4. Initiation of Bankruptcy Proceedings
-	Everything you need to know is in the Bankruptcy & Insolvency Act

Canadian Framework
-	Voluntary proceeding: Initiated by debtor, leading to debtor’s bankruptcy
-	Involuntary proceeding: Creditor (1 or more) indicates a proceeding, leading to debtor to become bankrupt when debtor alleged to (s.43 BIA): Owe more than $1000 AND committed an act of bankruptcy within 6 months preceding filing of petition
?	Debtor can defend itself
?	Who can petition? One or more creditors: s.2
?	Provable claim: s.121 ? It is a claim that you have against the debtor and a claim you have at the time you’re filing the claim; unsecured creditor does not have to go to court to obtain a judgment
?	S.43(2) Secured creditor ? May also petition a debtor into bankruptcy; can do that by giving its security entirely or by estimating the value of the security (May do this when an asset is worthless) 
?	Where is petition filed? At locality of debtor, ss.2, 43(5)
?	Locality of debtor: s.2
?	Who may be petitioned? A debtor (s.2) (with exclusions listed under s.48)
?	Debtor = insolvent person (Insolvent is also defined in the Act)
?	Insolvent person is not a bankrupt YET
?	Exclusions as to who may not be petitioned: s.48 (s.43-46 does not apply to these people)
?	When can petition be filed? S.43 – Petitioning creditor must have a debt owing to him that amounts to $1,000 (or if more than one creditor, aggregate of debts owing must amount to $1,000) s.43(1)(a); An act of bankruptcy must be committed (s.42) – must strictly prove every element of the claim
?	The acts of bankruptcy are listed under s.42
?	Some of these are voluntary and some of them are simply evidence of insolvency (so nothing fraudulent)
?	E.g. Debtor deliberately sets out to defraud its creditors
?	Fraud = Difficult to prove so can show presumption that there’s fraud and that will suffice under Act
?	S.42(1)(j) is most commonly used
?	Single creditor issue: 
?	Does failure to pay only one creditor qualify for an Act of Bankruptcy? Debt to a single creditor can qualify as an act of bankruptcy if there are special circumstances 
?	Remember s.43 ? Is it sufficient that the petition says I have not been paid or must they see if there are other creditors that have not been paid?
?	One creditor ? “I cannot see reason why, if there is only single creditor and there has been failure to pay that creditor, this cannot constitute ceasing to meet liabilities generally. To hold otherwise would be to deprive petitioning creditor of benefits of the BA” – Dixie Market
?	Where there are multiple creditors, can you rely on the Dixie Market case where the default to the petitioning creditor is all there is? “When relying on an act of bankruptcy [42(1)(j)] the petitioning creditor must strictly establish that the debtor ‘ceases to meet his liabilities generally as they become due” (except in special circumstances) – Holmes & Sinclair
?	If debtor has more than one creditor, s.42(1)(j) stipulates there must be class of creditors who are owed the debt
?	Not possible to say in this case whether in general the claims are being paid or not, so the court denied the petition
?	Court said you have to meet liabilities generally and where you have a general class of creditors and you only have one that’s petitioning, they will only allow the bankruptcy process only under special circumstances ? The special circumstances are articulated in this case 
?	** The other parts of this section require an intent to defraud your creditors so you may not always have enough evidence to show fraud
-	Proceeding = Petition for a receiving order (Court makes receiving order against debtor if the proceeding succeeds)

1.5 Outline of Canada’s Bankruptcy System (Pg. 96-103)
Introduction
-	Bankruptcy involves the liquidation of the debtor’s assets
?	For a business, liquidation means the end of the company in most cases and the legal form of incorporated business or partnership is wound up on liquidation 
?	For an individual, bankruptcy means a fresh start ? Many assets are liquidated, but the debtor is permitted to keep specific assets and the outcome of the bankruptcy process is a fresh start, free from the crushing burden of debts 
-	The difference is significant for the means by which liquidation of a debtor’s property may be initiated under the BIA:
?	First, a debtor may voluntarily enter bankruptcy by making an assignment of his/her property (BIA s.43(1)) ? Most cases of individual bankruptcy and some business bankruptcies are initiated by voluntary application 
?	Second, a debtor may be forced into bankruptcy by the application of one or more creditors (BIA s.43(2)) 
?	A debtor who has filed a commercial or consumer proposal under the BIA may also be forced into bankruptcy if the creditors do not give their approval of the proposal or if the court either does not ratify or annuls the proposal (BIA ss. 50, 5.4(8), 58, 62(2), 63(3), 66.31)

Application by Creditor
-	A creditor may make an application for a bankruptcy order if the debts owing to the applicant creditor amounts to $1,000 and the debtor has committed an “act of bankruptcy”, a defined term (BIA s.43(1))
-	A debtor commits an act of bankruptcy if the debtor:
1.	Makes an assignment of the debtor’s property to a trustee for the benefit of creditors;
2.	Makes a fraudulent gift, delivery, or transfer of the debtor’s property or any part thereof;
3.	Makes any transfer of the debtor’s property or any part thereof or creates any charge on it that under the BIA would be void as a fraudulent preference;
4.	With intent to defeat or delay creditors, departs or remains out of Canada;
5.	Permits any execution or other process issued against the debtor under which any of the debtor’s property is seized, levied on, or taken in execution to remain unsatisfied;
6.	Exhibits to any meeting of creditors any statement of the debtor’s assets and liabilities that show insolvency or the debtor’s inability to pay the debtor’s debts;
7.	Assigns, removes, secretes, or disposes of or attempts or is about to do so w/ intent to defraud, defeat, or delay creditors
8.	Gives notice to any of the debtor’s creditors that the debtor has suspended or is about to suspend payment of debts;
9.	Defaults in any proposal; and
10.	Ceases to meet his liabilities generally as they become due 
-	The application for bankruptcy is filed w/ the registrar in bankruptcy or, in some provinces, a master of the superior court who can issue a bankruptcy order
?	In some instances where the application is contested, it may be brought before a superior court judge
-	The phrase “date of initial bankruptcy event” is used throughout the Act to establish the effective date of bankruptcy in certain transactions 
-	By s.2, the “date of the initial bankruptcy event”, in respect of a person, means the earliest of the day on which any one of the following is commenced:
?	An assignment by or in respect of the person,
?	A proposal by or in respect of the person,
?	A notice of intention by the person,
?	The first application for a bankruptcy order against the person in the context of proposal proceedings;
?	The application in respect of which a bankruptcy order is made, other than one referred to in point 4; or 
?	Proceedings under the CCAA

Interim Receiver
-	The court may, if it is shown to be necessary for the protection of the estate of a debtor, at any time after the filing of the application for a bankruptcy order, appoint a licensed trustee as interim receiver of the property of the debtor (BIA s.46)
-	For a court to exercise its discretion to appoint an interim receiver for the period b/w the filing of an application for a bankruptcy order and the making of the bankruptcy order, the applicant creditor must establish through evidence that, on a balance of probabilities, the applicant creditor is likely to succeed in obtaining a bankruptcy order and there is an immediate need for protection of the debtor’s estate due to the grave danger that assets will disappear or the estate is otherwise in jeopardy (BIA s.46(1))

Assignment by Debtor
-	Before filing an assignment for an individual, a trustee must first make an assessment of the debtor 
-	Under the assessment procedure, the trustee must conduct a financial appraisal of the debtor and review the statutory and non-statutory options open to the debtor 
-	The trustee may delegate the assessment duties to a person who has registered w/ the designated assistant superintendent 
-	The assessment procedure is contained in directive no 6R3 of the superintendent of bankruptcy, “Assessment of an Individual Debtor”
-	An assessment certificate must be filed at the time of filing the assignment w/ the official receiver 
-	Mandatory efiling of all new summary administrations and ordinary administrations became effective in 2007
-	In practice, the trustee is chosen by the debtor before the assignment is filed 
-	The trustee before accepting the appointment, must be satisfied that the proceeds from the realization of the estate will be at least sufficient to secure the payment of the trustee’s lien 
-	In “no asset cases”, cash deposits or third-party guarantees are usually required by the trustee 
-	The trustee, having accepted the appointment and been approved by creditors, cannot withdraw from serving except w/ permission of the court 






















































































































































































Conclusion
-	Bankruptcy & insolvency law is highly codified in Canada ? However, where federal legislation intersects w/ important social, environmental, or economic legislation enacted at the provincial level, courts face the challenge of interpreting both types of legislation in a manner that will advance their respective socially important objectives within the framework of federal paramountcy

ss.5-11.1 BIA – Superintendent of Bankruptcy
ss. 12, 49(3)-(5), 105(1), 161, 162 BIA – Official Receiver (Bankruptcy)
ss.50.4 BIA – Official Receiver (Non-Consumer Proposals)
ss.34, 183-192 BIA – Court
s.192 BIA – Registrar in Bankruptcy 
ss.13-14.1 BIA – Trustee
ss.21, 25, 28, 40-21 BIA – Trustee
ss.116-120 BIA – Inspector 

Impact Tool & Mould Inc. (Trustee of) v. Impact Tool & Mould (Windsor) Inc. (Receiver of)

Issue:
-	Whether, and if so to what extent, the court may restrict the ability of a trustee in bankruptcy to provide the inspectors and creditors of the bankrupt estate w/ access to, or information from, the books, records and other documents of the bankrupt where there is a concern that the inspectors or creditors may use the information they obtain for purposes collateral (aka additional) to the administration of the bankrupt estate

Ratio
-	As general rule inspectors and creditors of bankrupt estate are entitled to access to books, records, and documents of bankrupt b/c they require that access to b able to carry out their important functions under the bankrupt legislation 
-	The use to which they may put the information obtained through that access is restricted to matters relating to the administration of the bankrupt estate 

Analysis:
-	B/c of the scheme of the bankruptcy regime, and the distinct role and responsibilities of inspectors in it, considerations governing the production of the bankrupt’s documents to them differ from the normal considerations concerning the production of private and confidential documents, and the protection of third party interests, in a lawsuit 
-	Would not say that there can never be situations where an order prohibiting access to inspectors might be appropriate, but some circumstances will, of necessity, be rare 
-	Apart from its rehabilitative goals with respect to personal bankrupts, the purpose of a bankruptcy is to gather in and realize upon the assets of the bankrupt and to distribute those assets amongst the creditors on an equitable basis, subject to their priorities ? In that sense, bankruptcy is a creditor-driven process, with the creditors pursuing their claims by collective action through the trustee in bankruptcy
?	The inspectors – appointed by the creditors under s. 116 of the BIA – are the creditors' representatives in this exercise
-	The inspectors' role is integral to the operation of the bankruptcy regime
?	As the creditors' representatives in the administration of the bankrupt estate, they owe a fiduciary duty to the general body of creditors, collectively
?	While the trustee in bankruptcy is vested with the assets of the bankrupt and is responsible for the day-to-day administration, it is the inspectors who have the primary supervisory role in the administration of the bankrupt estate
?	They have an obligation to be proactive and to keep watch on the trustee to ensure that assets are realized to the best advantage of the estate
?	The inspectors are the supervisors of the trustee and it is their function to instruct the trustee to take whatever steps they consider appropriate in order to protect the estate and the creditors
-	Re Hess:
?	[The general duty of the trustee] is to get in and administer the estate for the benefit of the creditors ? Many of the duties he performs under statutory authority alone
?	In matters of judgment, where the interests of the estate and creditors may be adversely affected, he is required to obtain the permission of the inspectors, as for example in the matters set out in s. 14 of the Act, which is not exhaustive
?	The inspectors of the estate are also statutory officials appointed under s. 94 of the Act ? They represent the interests of the creditors
?	They must be and must act independently of the trustee in the sense that they are not in a conflict of interest with the affairs of the estate, especially as to the matters set out in s. 94
?	They are required to supervise the trustee's administration of the estate generally and in matters specified in s. 14 of the Act and elsewhere
?	The inspectors are themselves subject to control and direction by the creditors by virtue of s. 94(9)
?	The fundamental concept is that the creditors are the final supervising authority in the administration of the estate, the inspectors represent their interest, the trustee's conduct is supervised by both; the overall administration of the estate is subject to the supervision of the superintendent by s. 5; in cases of dispute or doubt the court is resorted to for adjudication or direction for the purpose of the proper application of law
-	Although there is no specific provision in the bankruptcy legislation giving inspectors the general supervisory powers referred to above, the propositions arise from the scheme of the legislation and from the many and varied powers and supervisory duties invested in the inspectors throughout the BIA
-	The general nature of the inspectors' pivotal supervisory role is well-embedded in the jurisprudence
-	Re Feldman:
?	In other words the whole scope and foundation of The Bankruptcy Act is that in the practical administration of the estate of the bankrupt the governing authority shall be the inspectors and not the Court, the inspectors being practical men named by the creditors, and unless it is shown they are acting fraudulently or in some way not in good faith for the benefit of the estate, the administration of the affairs of the estate is to be governed according to their directions
-	A review of the BIA reveals a wide variety of inspector powers and responsibilities that underpin this overarching supervisory role:
?	For instance, s. 30 gives the trustee a broad list of powers that are essential to the administration of the bankrupt estate, but which can only be exercised with the permission of the inspectors ? These powers include the power to sell, lease, carry on the bankrupt's business as a going concern, institute or defend litigation, and settle debts owing to the bankrupt or any claims made by or against the estate
?	Proposals in bankruptcy must be approved by the inspectors: s. 50(3)
?	The trustee in bankruptcy must call a meeting of creditors if requested to do so by a majority of inspectors and if the trustee fails to do so a majority of the inspectors may convene such a meeting themselves: s. 103
?	Section 119 mandates that the trustee "shall have regard to any directions that may be given by resolution of the creditors at any general meeting or by the inspectors"
-	120(3) and (4) of the BIA:
?	(3) The inspectors shall from time to time verify the bank balance of the estate, examine the trustee's accounts and inquire into the adequacy of the security filed by the trustee and, subject to subsection (4), shall approve the trustee's final statement of receipts and disbursements, dividend sheet and disposition of unrealized property
?	(4) Before approving the final statement of receipts and disbursements of the trustee, the inspectors shall satisfy themselves that all the property has been accounted for and that the administration of the estate has been completed as far as can reasonably be done and shall determine whether or not the disbursements and expenses incurred are proper and have been duly authorized, and the fees and remuneration just and reasonable in the circumstances 
-	The broad limit to access imposed by the order of the Deputy Registrar and the order of the appeal judge upholding it cannot stand
-	At the same time, the jurisprudence is clear that inspectors have a fiduciary duty to the body of creditors generally, as well as the statutory duties imposed under the legislation
?	Inspectors must perform their duties impartially and in the interests of the creditors who appoint them
?	They may not use their position as inspector for purposes extraneous to the administration of the bankruptcy. It follows that access to the books, records and documents of the bankrupt must not be used for any such extraneous purposes

2. Initiation of Bankruptcy Proceedings
2.1 Involuntary Proceedings: Petition for Receiving Order (Pg. 107-124)
I. Introduction
-	There are basic differences in structure under the BIA b/w an involuntary application for a bankruptcy order brought by creditors under s.43 and the voluntary assignment by an insolvent person under s.49
?	The first is an adversarial proceeding and, predictably, the rules are much stricter 
?	The second proceeding is non-adversarial and the requirements are modest ? There is no judicial scrutiny of the assignment at this juncture, only a quick review of the documents by the official receiver to ensure formal compliance w/ the bankruptcy rules 
?	If creditors feel the assignment should not have been made, they must move to have the court annul the bankruptcy pursuant to s.181
-	Once the debtor has become a bankrupt, a common set of consequences follow for both voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings (E.g. The imposition of an automatic stay of proceedings against the bankrupt)

II. Initiation of Bankruptcy Proceedings
A. Involuntary Proceedings
-	In applying for a bankruptcy order under s.43, in addition to alleging that the debtor owing to the applicant creditor or creditors amounts to $1,000, the creditor or creditors must allege that the debtor has committed one or more of the acts of bankruptcy (listed in s.42) within the six months preceding the filing of the application 
?	The requirement of proof of an act of bankruptcy in an involuntary proceeding is an old concept
?	The acts of bankruptcy can largely be divided into acts involving culpable conducts and acts focusing on the debtor’s financial condition 

Roderick J Wood & David J Bryan, “Creeping Statutory Obsolescence in Bankruptcy Law”
-	[The] division b/w culpable conduct and insolvent financial condition is clearly exhibited in Canada  
?	The acts of bankruptcy that involve culpable conduct include making fraudulent gifts or transfers, making a fraudulent preference in the form of a transfer of property or the granting of a charge, departing or remaining out of Canada or absenting or departing from the debtor’s dwelling house w/ the intent of defeating creditors, and assigning, removing, secreting or disposing of property w/ intent to defraud, defeat or delay creditors
?	The acts of bankruptcy that relate to the debtor’s financial condition include the making of an assignment outside of Canada, permitting judgment enforcement measures to proceed beyond a specified stage, exhibiting a statement of assets and liabilities that shows that the debtor is insolvent or a written admission of an inability to pay at a meeting of creditors, giving notice of the suspension of creditors, defaulting on a proposal, or ceasing to meet his liabilities generally as they become due
-	Canadian bankruptcy law therefore contemplates that a solvent debtor may be forced into bankruptcy by the creditors 
-	The SCC in Century Services Inc. v Canada has identified the single proceeding justification as a foundational objective of insolvency law:
?	The single proceeding model avoids the inefficiency and chaos that would attend insolvency if each creditor initiated proceedings to recover its debt 
?	Grouping all possible actions against the debtor into a single proceeding controlled in a single forum facilitates negotiation w/ creditors b/c it places them all on an equal footing, rather than exposing them to the risk that a more aggressive creditor will realize its claims against the debtor’s limited assets 
-	A debtor who attempts to defraud a creditor acts wrongfully ? But the wrongfulness of this conduct is not something that requires the invocation of the single proceeding apparatus of bankruptcy law 
?	A creditor may seek to have the transaction set aside under provincial fraudulent conveyance law
?	It is only when the debtor is unable to pay several creditors that the single proceeding rationale of insolvency law is engaged 
-	There is, additionally, a highly practical reason why it might make sense to undertake a similar reform in Canada
?	The reality is that the acts of bankruptcy that relate to some form of misconduct on the part of the debtor are notoriously difficult to prove as they depend upon proof of an intent to defraud, defeat or delay the creditors
?	They are seldom invoked b/c the acts of bankruptcy that look to inability of the debtor to pay are much easier to prove 
-	Even if it were thought desirable to permit involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the debtor as a response to debtor misconduct, the present acts of bankruptcy are badly out of step w/ other changes that have been made to the bankruptcy provisions
-	In any event, it is necessary for the creditors to prove that the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transaction in order to prove that a transaction was a voidable preference under the Act ? It will therefore usually be easier for the creditors to assert the failure to meet obligations generally as the act of bankruptcy
-	The UK and US have abandoned the concept of an act of bankruptcy in involuntary bankruptcy proceedings ? Nor is the idea of eliminating the requirement of an act of bankruptcy a novel or radical idea in Canada
-	The move away from authorizing bankruptcy proceedings on proof of wrongful conduct of the debtor is consonant w/ the foundational principles of modern bankruptcy law and is also in line w/ bankruptcy reform initiatives elsewhere 
-	This is not to say that the matter can be simply resolved by eliminating the requirement of proof of an act of bankruptcy ? Once a decision is made to identify a general inability to pay obligations as the focal point, it becomes necessary to determine how difficult or easy it should be for creditors to convince a court that this is indeed the current state of affairs 
-	A thorough reform of the provisions respecting involuntary bankruptcy proceedings is clearly overdue

Re Dixie Market (Nurseries) Limited
-	In the absence of any arrangement for payment, the law of course is that it must be paid within a reasonable time, depending upon the circumstances
-	If there were liabilities to other creditors, there would be a question in this case, as to whether or not the act of bankruptcy has been committed, but this was one of those peculiar situations in which there was only one debt owing and that debt was the amount owing to the petitioning creditor
-	Whether or not the failure to pay a single creditor can constitute ceasing to meet liabilities generally as they become due is not an easy question ? There has been a # of decisions on this point 
-	Re Raitblat ? Decided that a failure to pay a single creditor may constitute ceasing to meet liabilities generally as they become due
-	Can see no reason why, if there is only a single creditor and there has been a failure to pay that creditor, this cannot constitute ceasing to meet liabilities generally ? To hold otherwise would deprive the petitioning creditor of the benefits of the Bankruptcy Act
-	In this case if the creditor is prevented from using the BA, he will be required to use the remedies of a judgment creditor – this means that assets cannot be disposed of for a year & the sheriff will have control of their disposal
?	Court found it a proper case for a receiving order to be made

Re Holmes and Sinclair
-	It is clear that the Courts, in Ontario at least, have granted a receiving order on the basis of a default to one creditor in special circumstances:
1.	The creditor is the only creditor of the debtor; and the debtor has failed to meet repeated demands of the creditor; in these circumstances he should not be denied the benefits of the Bankruptcy Act by reason only of his unique character; or
2.	The creditor is a significant creditor and there are special circumstances such as fraud on the part of the debtor which make it imperative that the processes of the Bankruptcy Act be set in motion immediately for the protection of the whole class of creditors; or 
3.	The debtor admits that he is unable to pay his creditors generally, although they and the obligations are not identified
-	Because this Court has in some of the recent decisions made a receiving order on proof of failure to meet a liability to a single creditor, it is not to be taken to have established a new principle that a petitioning creditor need only prove default w/ respect to the debt owing to him ? Those decisions do not lay down such a principle; they are merely the application to particular facts of the general rule … that when relying on an act of bankruptcy described in s.24(1)(j) the petitioning creditor must strictly establish that, in the words of the statute, the debtor “ceases to meet his liability generally as they become due;” 
?	In all of them the Court was influenced either by the existence of other creditors, or of one of the special circumstances set out above
-	In the non-exceptional case that situation cannot be ordinarily proved by having regard to the experience of one creditor only, even though he may be a major creditor
-	Resort to the statutory machinery of the Bankruptcy Act, rather than to the remedies to enforce a debt or claim in the ordinary Courts, is intended by Parliament to be for the benefit of the creditors of a debtor as a class, and the act of bankruptcy described in s.24(1)(j) is an act that singles out the conduct of the debtor in relation to the class, rather than to the individual
?	It is for this reason that the Court must be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence from which an inference of fact can fairly be drawn that creditors generally are not being paid
?	This requires as a minimum some evidence that liabilities other than those incurred towards the petitioning creditor have ceased to be met
?	The court ought not to be asked to draw inferences w/ respect to the class on the basis of one creditor’s experience where evidence of the debtor’s conduct towards other members of the class could, w/ reasonable diligence, be discovered and produced ? The court’s intuition is no substitute for the diligence of the petitioning creditor

Re Mastronardi (In Bankruptcy)
Facts:
-	One of the Ohio creditors turned to the Ontario courts and brought a petition for a receiving order under the BIA
-	This appeal invites a consideration of the statutory prerequisites of the BIA in the context of a foreign petitioner whose principal motivation for bringing the petition is a desire to collect $ owed to him pursuant to an order of a foreign court

Issue:
-	Did the bankruptcy judge err in holding that Mastronardi did not commit an act of bankruptcy by ceasing to meet his liabilities as they generally became due?

Analysis
(1) Single Creditor/Special Circumstances
-	There is a line of cases, anchored in Re Holmes and Sinclair, holding that a receiving order should not be based on a default to only one creditor unless there are “special circumstances” ? The bankruptcy judge applied Re Holmes and Sinclair and held that the receiving order was being sought by the only creditor of Mastronardi and that none of the special circumstances enumerated in Re Holmes and Sinclair applied
-	The bankruptcy judge erred in determining that Mastronardi had only one creditor ? In fact, there were at least 3 separate creditors 
?	The final judgment of the Ohio Court identified each of the three as a separate P and awarded specific damages to each P
?	The petition in this case was brought by a single creditor and asserted only the debt owed to that creditor
?	S.43(1) of the BIA provides that a bankruptcy petition may be filed by “one or more creditors” 
?	Accordingly, the bankruptcy judge did not need to consider whether there were “special circumstances” within the meaning of Re Holmes and Sinclair and its progeny, justifying a receiving order 
?	It was within his discretion to issue a receiving order on the basis that “the existence of two other unpaid debt is … sufficient to establish the act of bankruptcy”

(2) Lack of Serious Effort to Collect the Debt
-	The bankruptcy judge acknowledged that there was evidence that a demand had been made of the debtor
?	The bankruptcy judge recognized the legitimacy of the steps taken by the Brabanders to collect on the debt and he also knew that their efforts had been unsuccessful
?	Nevertheless, he decided not to grant the receiving order 
-	The bankruptcy judge erred in dismissing the petition for a receiving order on the basis that the appellant should have pursued other routes to collect on the debt owed by Mastronardi ? This is based on several reasons:
1.	If a petitioner can satisfy the requirements of the BIA, see no reason for denying him the access to the process and remedies of the Act b/c there may be other civil routes open to him ? The BIA is not a second-rate or fallback statute that can only be invoked if other avenues fail
?	Re Cappe: “I know of no statutory or common law which requires that a petitioner creditor have exhausted all other remedies available to that creditor to collect the debt owing to him or her before proceeding w/ a petition for a receiving order. In fact, the jurisprudence would seem to be to the contrary”
2.	Mastronardi appears from the record to have made suspect transfer of property at suspect times ? The prima facie conclusion the court drew was that Mastronardi was a man w/ substantial personal and business assets
?	The transfers constituted a compelling reason why a receiving order should have been granted 
?	If a receiving order was issued, time would start running backwards from January 1998, where the petition was issued, and the 3 transactions might fall within the trustee’s net under the BIA 
3.	Mastronardi owes 3 creditors more than $3.5 million pursuant to a valid Ohio court order ? In these circumstances, namely a lawful multi-million dollar debt, a person w/ substantial assets, and no payment at all, the bankruptcy route stroke the court as entirely appropriate 
?	There is no need for the petitioning creditor to spend time and $ continuing on the ordinary civil track when Mastronardi has not complied w/ his responsibilities on that track and when the petitioning creditor has established prima facie compliance w/ the statutory conditions of the BIA
4.	The bankruptcy judge’s concern “that the Bankruptcy Court would become in this case a collection agency for a single creditor” is misplaced ? This is not a single creditor case and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the appellant has invoked the BIA for any ulterior purpose, such as trying to force a creditor to deal w/ him to the exclusion of, or in the priority to, other creditors
?	The fact that the petitioning creditor desires to collect on the debt owing to him, is not an impermissible or disqualifying feature ? Virtually every creditor who initiates a bankruptcy petition would have this as an objective
?	Re Four Twenty-Seven Investments Ltd: “It is not an abuse of process or an improper purpose to commence a petition for the collection of a debt. It is not improper to petition to gain remedies not available outside of bankruptcy, including a thoroughgoing investigation of the bankrupt’s affairs. Indeed, on the evidence, I consider this to be a prototypal case where the full arsenal of investigatory mechanisms and remedies available to a trustee in bankruptcy would be useful, appropriate, and desirable”
-	In these circumstances, the petition for a receiving order complied w/ the requirements of the BIA and a receiving order was found to be “useful, appropriate and desirable”

Malmstrom v Platt
Issues:
-	Whether there was any demand for payment made w/ respect to the debts within 6 months of the petition and;
-	If there was not, whether such a demand was in fact necessary to establish an act of bankruptcy on the part of the debtor 

Analysis:
-	S.43(6) of the BIA, read in conjunction w/ s.43(1)(b), provides that before a court can grant a receiving order, it must be satisfied that the petitioner has presented proof that an act of bankruptcy was committed within 6 months preceding the filing of the petition
?	The theory behind the 6 month period appears to be that a petitioning creditor should not be permitted to rely upon stale-dated debts which have not been pursued in order to establish current acts of bankruptcy
?	However, it has been accepted that even in situations where a debt has become due more than 6 months before the date of the petition, a demand for payment made within the 6-month period revives the original debt ? Such a demand makes the debts current and failure to act on such a demand can serve as a current act of bankruptcy
-	It is important to consider the bald Q of whether it is necessary to make a demand where the debt is reduced to a judgment of the court pronounced outside the 6-month period ? This Q has not been dealt w/ satisfactorily in Canada 
?	Bankruptcy judge ? “Court judgments and orders are sufficient in themselves. They’re the ultimate demand. There is no necessity to keep on demanding on a periodic basis as to the payment under those directions of the Court”
?	The Court agreed w/ the position taken by the bankruptcy judge
-	There are cases that have held that it is not necessary to make a demand within the 6-month period, as long as there is evidence of a continuing default
-	Re Rayner:
?	The object of [the] limitation clearly is to prevent the filing of a petition for a stale default or isolated act of bankruptcy
?	It cannot, without disregarding the fundamental purpose of the Act, be held to apply to such a case … where a state of bankruptcy is shown to have continued w/o interruption from a time long prior to and down to the time of presentation of the petition and to be still subsisting; in other words a chronic state of bankruptcy existed for a period more than 6 months anterior to and down to the time of the presentation of the petition
-	Re The Pas Foundation ? “To refuse a petition merely b/c formal demands for payment had not been made in the 6 months prior to the issuance of the petition would … be unrealistic”
-	Re Aarvi ? In circumstances where the debtor has ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they became due for several years, where such situation continued up to a period of time which was within the 6 months preceding the date of the filing of the petition, and where there was also evidence that the debtor continued to fail to meet its interest obligations on its outstanding loans from the bank, it was unnecessary for the petitioning creditor to have to provide evidence that the demand was made within the 6-month period
-	Re Kaussen:
?	The reasons for the 6-month rule was to prevent a petitioning creditor from invoking a stale default as an act of bankruptcy 
?	Where there is no purpose to be achieved in making fresh demands b/c it is apparent that the debtor cannot or will not pay, the creditor is entitled to consider that default, once clearly established, continues in effect
?	His recourse should not be excluded b/c he fails to perform the empty gesture of demanding payment from someone who has already demonstrated his inability to respond
-	Court found case of Bombardier Credit Ltd. v Find to be particularly insightful:
?	Charron JA first found that demands for payments made during the 6-month period could revive debts that had accrued prior to the notice period ? This conclusion was based on a recognition that adopting the contrary view would result in the unnecessary filing of many petitions within 6 months of a debt accruing due by creditors who, out of an abundance of caution, may seek a remedy under the BIA simply for fear of forever being foreclosed from taking such action at a later time 
?	Charron JA went on to comment: “… this decision should not be interpreted to mean that a fresh demand must be made within 6 months preceding the filing of a petition in every case where a s.42(1)(j) act of bankruptcy is alleged in order to satisfy the requirements of the [BIA]. The issue is not whether a fresh demand has or has not been made but whether the evidence is sufficient to prove that the act of bankruptcy has been committed within the requisite time period. Of course the making of a fresh demand followed by a repeated default provides cogent evidence on this issue and may be a prudent practice to follow. However, even absent a fresh demand, the circumstances of the case may suffice to support a finding that the ceasing to meet liabilities generally as they become due extends to the relevant period of time”
-	Once a judgment or order has been entered against a debtor, no purpose would be served by forcing the creditor of that debtor to either file a petition immediately (and possibly prematurely), or to make repeated demands for payment once the petition is filed
-	It is inappropriate to require a creditor who has proceeded properly through legal channels and become a judgment creditor to make frequent demands for payment to the judgment debtor, only for the purpose of ensuring that the statutory time limitations are complied with ? A judgment is a continuing demand for payment by the judgment creditor just as the failure to satisfy the judgment is a continuing refusal by the judgment debtor 
-	Once a judgment or an order has been entered against a debtor, that judicial decree, even if entered more than 6 months before the filing of the petition, constitutes sufficient evidence of an act of bankruptcy having been committed within 6 months of the filing date
?	There is nothing improper in allowing a petitioning creditor to rely, as proof of bankruptcy, on formal judgments awarded against the debtor before the 6-month period 
?	Further, allowing petitioners to rely upon judicial pronouncements in order to establish current acts of bankruptcy is not contrary to the objectives of the BIA
-	Do not accept bankruptcy judge erred in holding that once court judgment or order has been entered against debtor, a demand for payment during the 6 months preceding the filing of the petition need not have been made in order to comply w/ the relevant BIA provisions 

January 31, 2018 
-	Speaker – March 14th
-	(j) ? Most commonly relied upon because they’re the easiest to prove
-	Outside of the debtor declaring it, or you proving fraud, the easiest way to go is the ceasing to meet general liabilities as they become due 
-	Dixie Market ? If one creditor, can go the bankruptcy route
-	Holmes ? If there is more than one creditor, but one creditor is not paid; There needs to be evidence outside that creditor that debtor has failed to meet general liabilities as they become due
?	Exception ? If there are special circumstances, the court will say default to one of several creditors will be okay
?	E.g. If creditor is only creditor and that creditor has made repeated requests & debtor has failed to pay; if the creditor is a significant creditor; debtor admits he is unable to pay his creditors generally;
?	Says first exception is if there’s only one creditor which is essentially Dixie Market 
-	What if no special circumstances exist? What is sufficient to establish “ceasing to meet liabilities as they become due?” ? This is the Mastronardi case 
?	One part of the analysis is there’s only one creditor ? CoA referred to Holmes and the judge said if there’s only one creditor, that creditor has to have special circumstances (In fact here, there isn’t one creditor – can’t lump people together b/c they’re one family)
?	Petition brought by one creditor but that doesn’t meant there’s one creditor in total
?	CoA’s analysis is important in determining having proof that there’s more than one creditor
?	A petitioning creditor needs to go past its own debt and showed that there’s another outstanding debt that’s owed ? The more you can show in a bankruptcy petition, the easier it will be to have that petition granted 
?	1) If a petitioner can satisfy the BIA, we’re not going to deny them access- even if there are other civil routes open, that doesn’t mean you don’t get the bankruptcy route; 2) Debtor has made suspect property transfers – doesn’t say there was fraud and there was on proof of it; 3) There’s no end in sight; 4) No evidence that creditor invokes BIA for another purpose (aka making threats); 5) The creditor saying I’m petitioning this debtor b/c I want what’s owed to me – this is not going to bar you from using the Act
?	If you meet the requirements of the bankruptcy code, you should be able to use it 
?	“Generally” ? Does not mean entirely but ‘in most cases’
?	This is something the court has to decide
?	If conduct investigation and creditor finds there are other creditors an they are also owed sufficient debts, this is enough
?	An exhaustive investigation is not needed ? But, it would be helpful for you if you did
?	The more evidence you get for ‘ceasing met liabilities generally’ the better your petition
?	S.42 has to be read in conjunction w/ s.43(7) ? Dismissing an application
?	If under s.43(7) the debtor is able to show that she’s able to pay her debts, the court cannot issue a receiving order
?	Remember, in order for you to be bankrupt, you have to be insolvent
-	Petition
?	When you have a petitioning creditor, the obligation is on that creditor to show that the provision they’re relying on has been met 
?	The onus is on them
?	This is b/c the bankruptcy code is penal in nature ? Therefore there’s a strict compliance requirement
?	Disputing the creditor: s.43(7)
?	6 month period (s.43(1)(b)): When does this begin to run? ? Where a debt has been reduced to judgment, the fact that the judgment has been entered more than 6 months before the filing of the petition is irrelevant. A judgment is a continuing demand for payment, and there is no necessary for a judgment creditor to make demands for payment in the 6 month period in order to comply w/ s.43(1)(b) (Malstrom v Platt) 
?	The whole point for the 6 month period the petitioning creditor should not be able to rely on old, stale debts that may be existing in various points in time that have never been pursued 
?	If you do have one of these stale debts, the court has to see that you’ve revived it within 6 months ? You have to make the debt current so you have to start making those demands
?	REMEMBER = when there’s a judgment you do not have to make continuing demands
-	Single Creditor
?	Recall special circumstances in which court will grant bankruptcy order against a single creditor
?	What if a single creditor obtains judgment? Can creditor rely on Platt principle to say the judgment is a continuing and repeated demand, and therefore falls within special circumstances? ? Fancsy Estate 
?	“The question for this court is whether the concept that a judgment constitutes a continuing demand will render every debt that has been pursued to judgment a special circumstance making that one debt evidence of an act of bankruptcy
?	The size of the judgment, how long it’s been outstanding, whether outstanding for long time, whether judgment creditor has conducted judgment debtor examination, what steps judgment creditor has taken to determine whether debtor has other creditors
?	CoA says a judgment does not qualify as special circumstances OR repeated demands ? Trial court did not take into account all of the circumstances 
?	Issue ? Is every single judgment a special circumstance, making one debt an act of bankruptcy? No (it is repeated demeands but doesn’t mean you automatically fit into s.42(1)(j)) – Must show that ‘ceasing to meet liability as they became due’ was the case 
?	Must look at the circumstances of the case
?	Not only saying ‘I have a judgment’ ? There are a lot of things you have to meet (This is a very litigated part of the bankruptcy code b/c everyone really wants to go under this section)
?	‘Judgment-debtor examination’ ? The debtor acknowledged there was an additional amount owing to somebody else so in this case where the only thing the estate did in order to try to petition the debtor under s.42(1)(j) was found not enough for the court
?	The lawyer in this case made a big mistake because the debtor himself admitted he owed $ to some other person and there was failure to adduce evidence and the petitioning creditor did not make that part of their claim
-	Re Smith
?	If the claimant says there’s another debt outstanding, if amount not determined, there is doubt to the existence of the debt ? Court doesn’t know if there are other creditors and the amount to each of those creditors
?	So the applicant creditor has to prove there are in fact other creditors 
-	UNWILLING to pay debts? ? Unable to give bankruptcy order if debtor is able but unwilling to pay debts (Petitioning order cannot be filed)
?	Once it is found that the debtor can pay his debts, the court “shall dismiss the petition” – Moody v Ashton
?	See also s.43(7)
?	Rule makes sense according to fundamental rule of bankruptcy ? Collective proceeding against a debtor when that debtor has insufficient assets to satisfy its creditors
?	Don’t say a creditor has to show financial statements as to the debtor’s inability to pay ? Just prove that an act of bankruptcy occurred
-	Secured creditor and petitioning for receiving order 
?	BMO v Scott ? Provincial statute gave unpaid wages priority but this would not be the case under the BIA (secured creditors will be given priority)
?	Issue: Was there an improper purpose?
?	Provincial priorities cannot affect bankruptcy priorities so what we can make sure of is consistency b/w the provinces
?	Cannot affect priorities created by federal statutes
?	If you want to amend this, it has to be parliament ? Has to defer to priority scheme in the BIA
?	A security interest in a claim is the ultimate claim so the rights given to workers is illusory
?	What we have now is the Wage Earner Protection Plan Act (Workers have higher protection now – the message of the case remains the same – if the provincial statutes create priorities, the bankruptcy statute is going to prevail) 
?	Not an improper purpose to want to invoke the bankruptcy proceeding to get better priority
?	If bankruptcy proceedings can generally be considered for the benefit of unsecured creditors through a mandatory collective proceeding, should secured creditors be entitled to petition a debtor into bankruptcy?
?	“Whether open to the court to dismiss a petition on the ground that it has been brought by a secured creditor for the purpose of bringing into effect the scheme of distribution in the Bankruptcy Act and thus destroying the priority which other creditors would otherwise have had” – Bank of Montreal v Scott
?	In provincial
?	s.43(2) ? Specifically permits a secured creditor to petition a debtor into bankruptcy, however, there are some requirements: 1) may give up its security entirely (may do that if asset is worthless); 2) indicate which portion of claim is secured and which is unsecured (unsecured must be at least $1000 – like every other unsecured creditor)
?	Application may be brought by SC to advance its own interests, regardless of how it affects debtor’s other creditors

2.1 Involuntary Proceedings: Petition for Receiving Order Cont. (Pg. 125-138)
Valente v Fancsy Estate
Facts:
-	This appeal concerns a disputed petition for a receiving order

Issue:
- Did the bankruptcy judge err in holding that the single debt owed to the petitioning creditor qualified under s.42(1)(j) of the BIA s “cea[sing] to meet … liabilities generally as they became due”?

Analysis:
-	Well-settled in the case law that the failure to pay a single creditor can constitute an act of bankruptcy under s.42(1)(j) when there are special circumstances, which have been recognized in 3 categories:
?	Where repeated demands for payment have been made within the 6-month period 
?	Where the debt is significantly large and there is fraud or suspicious circumstances in the way the debtor has handled its assets which require that the processes of the BIA be set in motion; and
?	Prior to the filing of the petition, the debtor has admitted its inability to pay creditors generally w/o identifying the creditors
-	In this case, debt has been pursuant to judgment 
?	The petitioning creditor does not state that repeated demands were made for payment of the judgment debt
?	Rather, the petitioning creditor relied on the case of Platt for the proposition that a judgment constitutes a continuing demand for payment and the failure to satisfy the judgment is a continuing refusal by the judgment debtor 
?	The bankruptcy judge applied Platt and found that the one judgment satisfied the first test from Holmes and constituted an act of bankruptcy under s.42(1)(j)
-	In Pratt, the court was satisfied based on the # of debts and the continuing failure to pay them, that an act of bankruptcy had been committed within the 6-month limit ? This may not be the case where a single creditor obtains a judgment and either shortly thereafter petitions the debtor into bankruptcy based on the judgment and the implicit demands, or does nothing for an extended period, then petitions on the basis that the judgment constitutes a continuing demand 
?	In neither case would the judgment be evidence of failure to meet obligations generally, as contemplated by the special circumstances doctrine
-	The Q for this court is whether the concept that a judgment constitutes a continuing demand will render every debt that has been pursued to judgment a special circumstance making that one debt evidence of an act of bankruptcy
-	Based on Pratt, once a debt has been pursuant to judgment, b/c that judgment constitutes a continuing demand for payment, it can form the basis for finding that it constitutes an act of bankruptcy based on special circumstances ? However, one judgment debt will not necessarily constitute special circumstances in every case
?	Ultimately the issue for the bankruptcy court on a petition for a receiving order is whether the creditor has proved that the debtor committed the act of bankruptcy alleged in the petition
-	Before the court can be satisfied that the failure to pay one judgment debt is tantamount to failing to meet liabilities generally as they become due, the court must examine and consider all of the circumstances including:
?	The size of judgment – small unpaid judgment is less likely to indicate act of bankruptcy than very large one;
?	How long the judgment has been outstanding – there may be reasons why a recently obtained judgment has not been paid as yet, including a potential appeal, the need to arrange for the marshaling of funds, intent to make arrangements for payment over time or in the case of a default judgment, knowledge of the judgment;
?	If a judgment has been outstanding for a long time, it may be that the debtor believes that the creditor is willing to wait for payment, and is paying his/her other debts as they fall due;
?	Whether the judgment creditor has conducted a judgment debtor examination and the results of that examination – if the judgment creditor can collect w/o invoking the mechanism of the bankruptcy process, a petition ought not to be granted;
?	What steps the judgment creditor has taken to determine whether the debtor has other creditors and the results of those inquires
-	In this case, the only other potentially relevant evidence was the existence of an other large judgment debt 
-	The onus is on the petitioning creditor to prove the act of bankruptcy ? The creditor could have called the bank as a witness on the petition or filed an execution certificate showing the continued existence of the debt

Notes:
-	Bankruptcy of SCM Farms Limited
?	The creditor obtained judgment against the debtor in 1991 ? The debtor renewed the judgment in 2001 
?	The debtor made no payments on the judgment and in 2007 the creditor applied for a bankruptcy order
?	The bankrupt appealed the registrar’s order on the basis that a judgment in 1991 could not form the basis of an act of bankruptcy as it had not occurred within the 6 months prior to the filing of the bankruptcy application
?	Court dismissed the appeal and upheld bankruptcy order, relying on the principle in Platt that a judgment was a continuing demand for payment:
?	The facts of this particular case stretch this principle to the utmost, yet I am persuaded that a judgment of the Court constitute a continuing demand for payment 
?	A creditor who ignores an outstanding judgment does so at their peril
?	The lack of any payment against that judgment for 16 years is clear evidence of an act of bankruptcy
-	In Re Inex Pharmaceuticals Corp, the CoA held that in order for a creditor to rely on s.42(1)(j) the liability must have come due and remain unpaid as of the date of the application 

Moody v Ashton ** In reviewing this case, consider the impact of BIA s.43(7) on an application for a bankruptcy order
-	The learned bankruptcy judge found that Mr. Ashton had committed an act of bankruptcy by ceasing to meet his liabilities generally as they became due ? But later in the judgment he also found Mr. Ashton was able to repay this amount 
-	The above two findings cannot stand together ? If Mr. Ashton was able to pay his debts, s.43(7) of the BIA prevented the bankruptcy judge from issuing the receiving order 
?	See no reason to give these words meaning other than the one they would ordinarily bear ? They are clear on their face
?	Once a bankruptcy court finds that a debtor is able to pay his or her debts, it “shall dismiss the petition”
-	S.144 directs that the bankrupt is entitled to any surplus remaining after the creditors have been paid
?	Court agreed that in its result, s.144 can apply only to solvent debtors ? But the section is necessary to deal w/ any surplus, no matter how small, which may arise from the sale of the debtor’s assets
?	There could be many reasons for a surplus including a miscalculation of the value of the debtor’s assets or a change in asset value 
?	Since s.144 serves these purposes, it cannot be read as counsel for the Moodys has asked the court to interpret it (that Parliament intended the Act to apply to solvent debtors who are able but unwilling to pay their debts)
?	It does not override the clear wording of s.43(7) which prevents a bankruptcy judge from issuing a petition where the debtor is able but unwilling to pay his or her debts
?	Interpreting s.43(7) in this way is consistent w/ the Act’s purposes which permit the orderly payment of the debts of persons who are unable to do so and reintegrates them into society
-	Given the conflicting findings made by the chambers judge, it is necessary to remit the matter to him for a determination as to whether Mr. Ashton was able to pay his debts in light of the Court’s interpretation of s.43(7)

Bank of Montreal v Scott Road Enterprises Ltd
Issue:
-	Whether it is open to the court to dismiss a petition in bankruptcy on the ground that it has been brought by a secured creditor solely for the purpose of bringing into effect the scheme of distribution in the Bankruptcy Act, and thus destroying the priority which other creditors would otherwise have had

Analysis:
-	S.43(2) appears to give the secured creditor the option to take one of two positions ? He can give up his security entirely or can give an estimate of its value 
-	Re Black Bros:
?	One purpose – usually the main purpose – of an order in bankruptcy is to secure an equitable distribution of the debtor’s property amongst creditors
?	However, another purpose may be to permit creditors to avail themselves of provisions in the Act which may enhance their positions, for example, by giving them certain priorities which they would not otherwise enjoy
?	The latter purpose, on the authorities, is a proper and sufficient basis for granting an order 
-	The use of bankruptcy proceedings in that way has often been directed against distraining landlords ? Triona Investment Ltd. v Smythe, McMahon Inc.
?	In leading BC cases it was accepted that there was no possibility of the bankrupt conferring any benefit on the general creditors 
?	It was nevertheless held to be proper for the secured creditor, in “jockeying for position” against the landlord, to “promote” a bankruptcy in order to defeat the priority which would otherwise be afforded to the landlord
-	The learned judge in Re Black Bros relied on the judgment of Henry J in Re Harrop of Milton Inc. ? Of some interest that Henry J felt bound to follow the earlier authorities 
?	“Detect an implication of similar misgivings in the language of McKenzie J in this case; as there was in my observations in Triona Investments Ltd.”
?	“We were also referred to expressions of misgiving by learned commentators” ? Alan Kemp-Gee: “The Bankruptcy Act specifically states that, w/ a few exceptions, secured creditors are free to deal w/ their security in a commercially reasonable fashion outside the Act; Therefore, use of bankruptcy by a secured creditor seems to contravene the spirit of the legislation”
-	The circumstances of this case illustrate starkly the inequitable consequences which can flow from permitting the debentureholder to employ the Bankruptcy Act to destroy the priority which would otherwise have been enjoyed by the Crown and the wage earners
-	Federal Business Development Bank v. Quebec ? Lamer J made an obiter statement which is clearly in point:
-	It is the last paragraph which is relevant to the issue raised here ? This is a case in which the secured creditor brought about the bankruptcy of its debtor solely in order to improve its title 
-	The paragraph represents a considered dictum of the court in relation to a Q, especially one of policy, as to the effect to be given to a federal statute ? It is a dictum which this court was found bound to follow and to apply by holding that such a circumstance is not sufficient cause to refuse to grant the receiving order
?	If the present state of the law is unsatisfactory, it is for Parliament to remedy it
-	Wages are not a debt like any other – it has always been recognized that b/c of their nature they should be accorded a high degree of protection 
?	The Bankruptcy Act recognizes that principle by putting wage-earners just after the trustee in the order of distribution in s.136(1)
?	But, in present-day circumstances, that is an illusory benefit
-	The difficulty thus created for wage-earners may be very serious b/c the extent to which the legislative scheme can be set at nought by the device employed here may be almost complete
-	The essence of the legislative scheme is to provide a first charge
-	Most businesses large enough to have employees carry on at the sufferance of their bankers in the sense that their loans may be called on demand, thus crystallizing the bank’s security on every asset of every kind
-	It follows that, in most cases, the bank will be in a position to do what was done here, i.e., to employ its security to make the debtor effectively bankrupt, and then to petition it into bankruptcy
-	B/c of the inherent flexibility of its security, the bank in all such cases will be in a position to time the appointment of the receiver, as was done here, to arrange matters so that the understanding will have the benefit of the employees’ efforts for a maximum period 
-	An incidental undesirable consequence of this device is that in addition to the always substantial layer of costs created by a receivership, the happening of bankruptcy will create a further layer of costs to be met before any payment can be made to wage-earners under s.136(1)(d)

Notes
-	BMO v Scott is authority for the well-settled proposition that an application may be brought by a secured creditor to advance its own interests regardless of how it affects the debtor’s other creditors 
-	This principle was applied by the Ontario CoA in Re Ivaco Inc. 
?	CoA concluded in that case that the bankruptcy procedure was proper even if it meant altering non-bankruptcy priorities
?	“Subject to specific exceptions, the BIA aims to distribute a bankrupt debtor’s estate equitably among all of the estate’s creditors. There are undoubtedly compelling policy reasons to protect pension rights in an insolvency. But, as I have said, it is for Parliament, not the courts, to do so …”
?	“The petitioning creditors have met the technical requirements for bankruptcy. And their desire to use the BIA to alter priorities is a legitimate reason to seek a bankruptcy order”
?	“Where a creditor seeks to petition a debtor company into bankruptcy at the end of CCAA proceedings, any claim under a provincial deemed trust must be dealt w/ in bankruptcy proceedings. The CCAA and the BIA create a complementary and interrelated scheme for dealing w/ the property of insolvent companies, a scheme that occupies the field and ousts the application of provincial legislation. Were it otherwise, creditors might be tempted to forgo efforts to restructure a debtor company and instead put the company immediately into bankruptcy. That would not be a desirable result.”
-	A secured creditor w/ a general security interest in the debtor’s property often files a s.43 application even though the secured creditor has installed a privately appointed receiver-manager to enforce its security interest ? This does not mean that the receiver-manager is displaced on the appointment of the trustee in bankruptcy, b/c there is no such requirement in the BIA
?	On the contrary s.71 makes it clear that the vesting of the debtor’s property in the trustee is qualified by the rights of the secured creditor 
-	In practice, to reduce costs, the secured creditor’s application under s.43 will frequently designate the receiver-manager as trustee ? This practice is expressly sanctioned in s.13.4 of the BIA
Re Smith
Issue:
-	 Has Servus adduced sufficient evidence as to Smith’s failure to pay debts due to other creditors so as to support a Bankruptcy Order?

Analysis:
-	S. 42(1)(j) of the BIA requires the applicant creditor to prove that creditors are not generally being paid ? Strict proof by the applicant creditor is required 
?	Evidence before the court failed to satisfy the requirements of s.42(1)(j) 
-	Also not satisfied that Servus has met the special circumstances requirements described in Re Valente to permit a court to find that the failure to pay a single creditor constitutes an act of bankruptcy under s.42(1)(j) ? This case stands for the proposition that repeated demands for payment made within the 6 month period preceding the filing of the application can amount to special circumstances

ss.42-45, 48, 181
2.2 Voluntary Bankruptcy: Assignments in Bankruptcy (Pg. 138-142)
-	Transfers all the debtor’s assets to a trustee in bankruptcy ? property vests in trustee s.71 (for the benefit of the creditors)
-	No litigation involved
-	Corporate debtor, “person”
-	Has to be an “insolvent person”: ss. 2, 49
?	Not be “bankrupt”
?	Reside, carry on business or have property in Canada; and
?	Have liabilities to creditors provable as claims under the Act amounting to $1,000
-	Types of bankruptcy administrations
?	If debtor is individual, there is ordinary and summary ? Trustee in bankruptcy must make an assessment of that person and the trustee has to decide by looking at the evidence and review all of the options available to him
?	Annulment ? “If in the opinion of the court a bankruptcy order ought not to have been made or an assignment ought not to have been filed, the court may annul the bankruptcy” 
?	Effect of annulment
?	Once assignment is made, court has power to annul bankruptcy 
?	If you have a petition for a receiving order, that has to go to court and you will not get an annulment so it’s much more typical to seek an annulment after an assignment has been made b/c an assignment does not have to go to court
-	If the debtor has met definition of insolvent person and s.42(1)(a), then receiving order given unless there’s an improper purpose ? Just because they gain some benefit, doesn’t mean that’s an improper purpose 
-	“Locality of the debtor” ? Re Maschek
?	The person has to be: 1) Debtor; 2) Insolvent person
?	Locality of the debtor is also defined
?	Just b/c he has debts doesn’t mean he’s running a business
-	Annulment ? s.181
?	(1) If order or assignment improper, court can annul bankruptcy
?	(2) What happens to the property upon the annulment of an assignment
-	If you do have an assignment, most common ground to annul:
?	The debtor does not meet definition of insolvent person at date o filing assignment 
?	The person who purported to make the assignment was not authorized to do so (E.g. general partner not able to do so on behalf of limited partners)
?	Where it’s an abuse of process of the courts ? Tried to use bankruptcy process w/ a fraudulent design 
?	Where it’s a fraud on creditors
-	Consequence of annulment
?	Bankruptcy goes to former position, as if bankruptcy never occurred
?	Stay of proceedings lifted
?	Debtor is liable for all pre-bankruptcy and post-bankruptcy debts
?	Debtor’s property that vested in the trustee, re-vests in the debtor
-	Recall: Annulment of bankruptcy does not invalidate transactions or payments made by the trustee
-	Re Wale
?	There was a sign and he shut down his business when there was a backlog of orders ? He had business (Question as to whether or not his business is dying and whether or not he has done something in order to close it down)
?	When he filed his assignment, he had orders for at least 5 kitchens and he had received deposits from 4 of these customers ? Huge indicator that something is off here 
?	Wife seeks to annul bankruptcy ? Remove couple’s assets out of her reach which would result in unequal division
?	Court goes to general principles ? Insolvent person? Did he commit fraud or was there an abuse of process? Just need to prove one
?	He kind of is an insolvent person but barely (He didn’t have sufficient cash flow to meet his liabilities and his cheques were being returned) 
?	But what about the abuse of process argument? S.181 ? Court has wide discretion when considering an annulment application (Test is flexible and fact specific) (Pg. 146)
?	Court concluded Mr. Wale could have worked himself back 
?	By looking at all the evidence showed that if he had tried, he would have easily pulled himself out of his situation
?	Found that his feelings towards his former wife shows that his motive was to defraud his wife and this is an abuse of process
?	Assignment to brankrupty not granted
-	A debtor can make an assignment if the debtor is an insolvent person (and motive is not important) but if someone wants to annul the assignment they can use motive to assist them

Introduction
-	In order to make an assignment in bankruptcy under BIA s.49, a debtor must be an “insolvent person” as defined by BIA s.2
?	An assignment is a non-adversarial proceeding that only requires the debtor to file the required documentation w/ the official receiver
?	However, creditors may seek to annul the bankruptcy under s.181 of the BIA

Re Dahl
-	It was held in Eastern Trust Co. v Lloyd Mfg. Co.; Re Jarvis that bankruptcy rules are a full and complete code and formed for purpose of providing a summary and expeditious method for determining questions arising in bankruptcy matters w/ a minimum of cost ? The jurisdiction of the court in bankruptcy is given by the Bankruptcy Act
-	The Act does not give the court authority either on an interim or permanent basis to stay a receiving order or an assignment ? The court is given authority to stay petitions but not to stay a receiving order 
-	The Act does not give the court authority to annul the bankruptcy ? Any legal actions seeking that remedy should be fashioned accordingly
-	Even if an assignment is filed to defeat the claim of a judgment creditor, there is nothing unlawful about such assignment and the court will not set it aside
-	The bankruptcy of the debtor will not be annulled simply b/c by his assignment he gains benefits for himself, provided that his assignment meets the requirements of the Act
?	The validity of the assignment, therefore, would depend entirely on the debtor satisfying the requirements of the Bankruptcy Act so long as there is no abuse of the process of the court
?	An interested person wishing to have the bankruptcy annulled would adduce evidence to show that the debtor was not an insolvent person when he made his assignment, or alternatively, there is some other ground recognized by the court that satisfies the court that the assignment ought not to have been filed 
?	Such an application should be made by notice of motion and, if need be, the directions of the court should be sought as to the procedure to be followed 

Re Maschek (Proposed Bankrupt)
Facts:
-	The Official Reciver held Mr. Maschek’s assignment nd not registered the filing on the basis that it is not clear that he complies w/ s.49(3) of the BIA ? That section provides that the assignment shall be offered to the Official Receiver in the locality of the debtor (“Locality of the debtor” defined in s.2)
?	S.2 says that “locality of a debtor” means the principal place where the debtor has carried on business during the year immediately preceding his bankruptcy, or, where the debtor has resided during the year immediately preceding his bankruptcy, or, in cases not coming within those two situations, where the greater portion of the property of the debtor is situated

Issue:
-	In order to determine if this assignment should be accepted by the office of the Official Receiver, two issues must be decided: Is Mr. Mascheck a “debtor” as defined in s.2 of the BIA? IF he is a “debtor”, does he meet one of the requirements for “locality of a debtor” set out in s.2 of the Act?

Analysis:
“Locality of a Debtor”
-	The mere existence of the debts incurred by an individual is insufficient to qualify him as someone who carried on business 
-	The meaning of “during the year immediately preceding his bankruptcy” was considered in In re. W. C. Polson Estate:
?	The court found the primary and ordinary meaning of the word to be “at some time within”
?	Can a deemed Canadian residency for the 2006 tax year bring Mr. Mascheck within the requirement of s.2 of the BIA that he be a resident of the locale during the year immediately preceding his bankruptcy? Bot the Income Tax Act and the BIA are federal statutes ? As a general principle of statutory interpretation, federal statutes should work harmoniously, one w/ the other
?	The two Acts did not deal w/ the same subject ? However, they both deal w/ the financial affairs of citizens 
?	There is no definition of resident provided in the BIA
?	The presumptiosn of coherence and consistency indicate that the definition in the Income Tax Act could be applied to the BIA
-	It would be incongruous to treat Mr. Maschek as a resident of Canada for the purposes of taxing his income but refuse to accept that he is a resident of Canada for the purposes of filing an assignment in bankruptcy ? To do so could lead to the result that he could incur unsustainable tax debt with no ability to seek the protection of bankruptcy
?	Such a result would offend the presumptions of coherence and consistency referred to by Dreidger
?	If Mr. Maschek is deemed to be a resident of Canada for the purposes of the Income Tax Act and, therefore, is a resident for the purposes of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, he must be a resident of a locale

“Debtor”
-	To come within the requirements of “locale of the debtor”, Mr. Maschek must also be a debtor
-	The Act defines “debtor” as including an insolvent person and any person who, at the time an act of bankruptcy was committed by him, resided or carried on business in Canada and, where the context requires, includes a bankrupt
-	Mr. Maschek is not yet a bankrupt ? From the facts presented it is unclear when the act of bankruptcy occurred
-	For the purposes of making this determination, the court assumed that the act of bankruptcy occurred prior to Mr. Maschek being released from the armed forces ? Therefore, for the reasons that are set out above, that would render him a person who, at the time the act of bankruptcy was committed, resided in Canada
-	Unless Mr. Maschek committed act of bankruptcy triggering this assignment in 2007, the assignment was to be filed

s.49, s.2
s.57, 61(2), 63(4), 69.3(1), 69.4, 155

2.3 Annulment
Re Wale
Facts:
-	Wale’s assignment in bankruptcy was date-stamped by the Official Receiver an hour and a half before the commencement of his family law trial
-	His former wife brought this motion, under s.181 of the BIA, to annul the bankruptcy and to vest his property in her pending the outcome of the family law trial, or to exempt her claims from the usual stay of creditor proceedings under s.69.3, and other relief 
-	She argued his filing was motivated solely by his desire to defeat her family law claims and was an abuse of the process of the court 
-	Wale said he had no such intention, he is an “insolvent person”, as defined by the act and is entitled to its protection

Analysis
-	The jurisdiction of this court, sitting as a bankruptcy court, is limited by the special rules and procedures set out in the Act
?	The court has no authority, either on an interim or permanent basis to stay an assignment
?	However, the Act does give the court authority to annul a bankruptcy
-	An annulment will be granted only where it is shown either the debtor was not an insolvent person when he made the assignment or where it is shown that the debtor abused the process of the court or committed a fraud on his creditors

Was Mr. Wale an Insolvent person When He Made the Assignment?
-	Here, Mr. Wale’s liabilities exceeded $1000 when he made the assignment ? He satisfies the preamble requirement
-	Subsections (a), (b) and (c) of the definition are disjunctive
?	If he has debts exceeding $1000 a person claiming insolvency must show either (a) he is unable to meet his obligations as they generally become due or (b) he has ceased paying his current obligations in the ordinary course of business or (c) establish his assets, if sold, would not yield sufficient $ to pay his debts 
?	Wales argued he complied w/ both ss. (a) and (b) ? But court argued Wale had an ability to meet his obligations as they generally became due and he simply chose not to do so; He does not meet the criteria under ss. (a)
?	Mr. Wale had ceased paying his current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they generally became due 
?	Unlike ss. (a) which requires the debtor to show an inability to meet obligations, ss. (b) requires only that the debtor “has ceased paying his current obligations in the ordinary course of his business”
?	Unlike ss. (a) there is no requirement in ss. (b) for the debtor to show and thus no need to investigate his inability to make payments ? If he has ceased paying current obligations, he meets the criteria of this subsection
?	Must assume that reference by parliament to a debtor’s “inability” in ss. (a) and not in ss. (b) is intentional and the easier test in the business oriented subsection, i.e., ss. (b), was imposed for a specific reason
-	Mr. Wale qualifies as an insolvent person, if only marginally so, and was therefore entitled to make an assignment in bankruptcy, unless in doing so he abused the process of the court or committed a fraud on his creditors 

Was There an Abuse of the Court’s Process?
-	Numerous cases conclude that the debtor’s motive in making an assignment is not generally relevant ? There is nothing unlawful in declaring bankruptcy for the sole purpose of defeating the claims of one’s creditors
-	One of the objectives of bankruptcy legislation is to permit the debtor “to protect himself from the evils which he might otherwise suffer” ? However, this general principle must always be tempered by the caveat that fraud or abuse of the process will permit a court to annul the assignment 
?	Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada ? “The court must consider the rights not only of the debtor and of the creditors but laso the rights of the public. A bankrupt should not be permitted to benefit from his own turpitude”
?	Re Fuller; Blaxland et al v Fuller ? “If, however, the conduct is tainted by bad motives, then the Court remains able to annul a bankruptcy under s.181 of the Bankruptcy Act”
-	Under s.181 the Court has a wide discretion when considering an annulment application ? An exhaustive review of the circumstances surrounding the assignment should be made by the Court 
?	There is no single test or principle to be applied
?	The test is flexible and fact specific
?	The debtor’s motive is the primary consideration in determining abuse of process or fraud 
-	After considering whether the debtor is an insolvent person some of the Qs the court might pose to ascertain the debtor’s motive are:
?	Is the debtor’s financial situation genuinely overwhelming or could it have been managed?
?	Was the timing of the assignment related to another agenda or was bankruptcy inevitable in the near or relatively near future?
?	Was the debtor forthcoming in revealing his situation to his creditors or did he hide assets or prefer some creditors over others?
?	Did the debtor convert $ or assets to himself which would otherwise have been assets in the bankruptcy?
?	What had been the debtor’s relationship w/ his creditors, particularly his major ones? Was it such that they might have assisted him, if he had approached the, by granting time or terms of repayment or had any goodwill been destroyed by past unfulfilled promises?
?	Are there other relationships – business partnerships, shareholder agreements, spousal, competitors for an asset, or simply personal associations which could cast light on a possible bad faith motive for making an assignment?

Conclusion
-	I have little difficulty concluding he made his assignment w/ the intention of removing assets from the reach of the Court and his former wife so as to frustrate her claim for an unequal division of them 
-	The assignment was an abuse of the process of the bankruptcy court and a fraud on at least one of his creditors, his former wife 

Note:
-	There are important differences b/w an application for a bankruptcy order brought by a creditor or creditors under BIA s.43 and a voluntary assignment of property for the benefit of creditors made by an insolvent person (who or which may be a natural person or legal entity) pursuant to BIA s.49 
-	It seems that an assignment can be made as of right so long as the debtor-assignor satisfies the requirement of “insolvent person” under BIA s.2(1)
?	No hearing is involved and apparently the official receiver has no discretion to refuse an assignment if the paperwork is in order
?	However, an assignment can be annulled under BIA s.181 (just as a bankruptcy order can be annulled under the same section), but the basis on which the court can or should exercise its discretion remains unclear 
-	 Contrast the simplicity of an assignment to the much more complex proceedings involved where a creditor (defined in BIA s.2) brings an application for a bankruptcy order
?	Here, even if a creditor proves the debtor’s “act of bankruptcy” (defined in BIA s.42(1)), the court may refuse the bankruptcy order if it concludes that the debtor is able to pay his/her debtors or that “for other sufficient cause” no order ought to be made (BIA s.43(7))

Vanderwoude v Scott & Pichelli Ltd.
Facts:
-	A landscape supply company (VLS) made a voluntary assignment in bankruptcy ? A trustee was appointed and in less than a month, the trustee arranged for the sale of most of the assets of the company
-	The proceeds from this sale were distributed to a single secured creditor, NCU
-	Two other secured creditors, whose security ranked behind NCU’s, were unhappy w/ the trustee’s administration of the estate ? They brought a motion seeking leave, pursuant to s.215 of the BIA, to issue a Statement of Claim against the trustee 
?	Registrar Ferron refused to make such an order
-	The creditors appealed to the SCJ ? Dismissed
-	Creditors appealed to this court 

Issue:
-	What are the circumstances in which a disgruntled creditor can sue the trustee for the manner in which the trustee administers the estate of a bankrupt 

Analysis:
-	The test for making an order under s.215 of the BIA was recently summarized by Charron J.A. in Society of Composers, Authors & Music Publishers of Canada v Armitage:
?	The evidence required to support an order under s.215 must be sufficient to establish that there is a factual basis for the proposed claim and that the proposed claim discloses a cause of action
?	However, the evidence does not have to be sufficient to enable the motions judge to make a final assessment of the merits of the proposed claim 
?	The sufficiency of the evidence must be measured in the context of the purpose of s.215, which is to prevent the trustee from having to respond to actions which are frivolous or vexatious or which do not disclose a cause of action
-	A trustee in bankruptcy must take into account the interests of the debtor and of all the creditors ? To require the trustee to be bound by an agreement b/w the bankrupt and a single creditor would be inconsistent w/ this fundamental obligation 
?	In short, if the appellants have a claim on this issue, it is one against VLS and its principal, Peckham, and not against the trustee
-	Peat Marwick Ltd. v. Consumers’ Gas Co.:
?	It seems to me that the receiver and manager in a situation, like the present, is wearing two hats 
?	When wearing one hat, he is the agent of the debtor company; when wearing the other, the agent of the debenture holder 
?	In occupying the premises of the debtor and in carrying on the business, the receiver and manager acts as the agent of the debtor company
?	In realizing the security of the debenture holder, notwithstanding the language of the debenture, he acts as the agent of the debenture holder, and thus is able to confer title on a purchaser free of title 
-	Accordingly, it follows that, when the trustee sold VLS’s assets to Brickyard, it was able to confer title to the assets on Brickyard b/c it was acting as NCU’s agent, not the bankrupt debtor’s agent
-	Vanderwoude and Vanswan were both represented at the first meeting of the VLS’s creditors ? Vanderwoude was there in person 
-	Mr. Faber, a solicitor representing Vanderwoude, was appointed an inspector at the first meeting of creditors ? He did not object to the sale of VLS’s assets to Brickyard; indeed, he made no comments concerning the sale 
-	Appellants knew what the trustee proposed to do, and in fact did, w/ respect to the sale of VLS’s assets ? They made no objection until 2 years later until they brought their motion seeking leave to commence an action against the trustee 
-	The appellants’ conduct counts strongly against permitting the action to proceed 
-	Lower courts were correct in refusing to grant the appellants leave pursuant to s.215 of the BIA to commence an action against the trustee of the estate of the bankrupt VLS

7. Consequences of Bankruptcy
Process
-	Beginning: Trigger mechanism – 1) Assignment or 2) petition for receiving order
-	Middle: What is TB going to distribute? What is property of estate? Included or excluded? Can TB enlarge the pool of assets by looking at pre-B transactions? How is that property distributed? (What is the priority for creditors?)
?	Once you have assignment petition for receiving order, how dose the trustee deal w/ the bankrupt and all the other creditors?
?	How can the trustee enlarge that pool of assets by looking at transactions that occurred before the bankruptcy?
?	What is presumed to be income? ? What happens w/ the income, it is also distributed to creditors and after the discharge occurs, what happens? Does the bankrupt keep paying from that income?
-	End: Discharge? Director liability?

The Stay
-	S.69.3
-	No creditor has any remedy against the debtor or debtor’s property & cannot commence an action
-	The trustee would have nothing to distribute if the unsecured creditors were not stayed ? Secured creditors can collect on their security but if the unsecured creditors were able to collect from the bankrupt, then there’s no point on having a trustee there
-	There are some claims that survive bankruptcy ? Student loans, child support payments, finding of fraud and compensation issued for that – those are not discharged
-	Fitzgibbon ? Can this order be issued while the person is undercharged? 
?	The granting of an order had 2 steps: 1) When the order is made by the court, which imposes an obligation to pay; 2) when the order is filed w/ the superior court and becomes enforceable
?	The holding of a judgment does not do anything until you actually file it
?	These two stages, the enforcement of judgment is precluded BUT the court said it doesn’t include actually issuing the order ? The compensation order does not violate the stay of proceedings (Making of the order vs. registration of the order where it actually becomes enforceable against the bankrupt)
?	You can’t register the order b/c that would contravene the stay 
?	The aim of the section is maintaining control over the distribution of assets
?	The object of section is to avoid multiplicity of proceedings
?	Simply acknowledgment that there has been fraud perpetuated on the victims (stay is broad)
?	BUT exception ? Fraud in this case (The court is harsher when it comes to fraud so it didn’t contravene the stay and didn’t allow judgment to be registered or enforced but did allow victims to say that fraud was perpetrated here)
?	So fresh start applies but there are certain exceptions (The exception that applies here is fraud and this fraud here is pretty significant; probably outcome would’ve been different if there was no fraud)
?	REMEMBER Two steps of having a judgment: 1) You were wrong and you should compensate; 2) Registration of that judgment (Once you register is when you can do something with it)
-	Vachon 
?	What is the scope of the stay? Does it only encompass judicial proceedings? But what about non-judicial proceedings?
?	Bankrupt owed unemployment insurance commission ? Debt had been incurred w/o fraud (So if obtain discharge, this debt would have been discharged)
?	The debt was provable in bankruptcy 
?	Commission withheld $ during the time the guy was bankrupt ? Through the unemployment insurance
?	Rather than waiting for him to pay, they took the $ themselves and they were entitled to do so under the statute
?	Bankrupt discharged and sought an order that the commission had acted unlawfully by holding those benefits 
?	Q: Whether the recovery of overpayments by retaining subsequent benefits or reducing the $ payable, does that violate the stay? Should the commission have sought leave of the court 
?	Must interpret stay very broadly ? Judicial and extra-judicial proceedings covered
?	A very broad meaning which covers any kind of attempt at recovery, judicial or extra-judicial ? Any remedial right which an aggrieved party is entitled w/ or w/o a judicial tribunal
?	The Bankruptcy Act governs bankruptcy in all aspects so that legislature wishes to suspend all proceedings – administrative and judicial so we must give a broad interpretation to the word remedy 
?	Commission argued unemployment insurance not able to be seized by trustee so that simply means those funds are not available for creditors so how come they are barred from taking the $ when it is the bankrupt’s property? 
?	Court rejected this
?	Court applied statutory interpretation ? The word is property not property that his non-exempt; Since the provision itself does not distinguish, the out is not going to
?	Equitable distribution of creditors is not the sole purpose of stay and bankruptcy law; there is a rehabilitation aspect as well; “fresh start”
?	Would defeat one of the purposes of bankruptcy 
?	Purpose of stay is to gather all the property ? Non-exempt is for creditors and exempt is for the bankrupt  
?	The stay is really broad and covers not just judicial remedies but covers extrajudicial remedies
-	S.69.4 ? Creditor can seek leave from the court 
?	Show that creditor is likely to be materially prejudiced; 2) Equitable under other grounds that the stay may be lifted
?	In order to show a material problem that could result to a creditor, if there’s fraud, you might be able to have the proceeding continued, and that’s under equity, but general principle is that unsecured creditors are stayed and are not able to continue w/ their enforcement proceedings
-	Secured creditors do have ability to go in and seize property ? Trustee has to let them
?	But if there is surplus, that surplus must be put back into the estate
?	Trustee has power to keep property in estate to make sure secured creditor is not taking more than what’s covered under their secured interest (Helps unsecured creditors)
?	“Secured Creditor” ? s.2 
?	s.69.3(2) ? The stay does not affect secured creditors
?	Effect of bankruptcy on secured creditors ? If proposals or of that sort, then stay would cover secured creditors as well
?	Court may postpone secured creditors acting on their secured interest ? Trustee may ask the court to do this or may just ask for directions from the court
?	79 ? Inspect property subject to a security interest 
?	128 ? Require secured creditor to give proof of security and value (If no reply within 30 days, trustee may dispose property w/ leave of court)
?	When we’re dealing w/ bankruptcy, time is of the essence 
?	Happens a lot faster than general proceedings
?	128(3) ? Allows trustee to redeem security interest
?	129 ? If trustee is dissatisfied of security assessed, can ask for the property to be sold
?	Trustee CAN interfere w/ the rights of a secured creditor
?	All of these interferences is to protect the unsecured creditors that the trustee represents

Other Effects of Bankruptcy
-	S.70(1) ? Receiving order and assignment will have priority over all judgments; trustee over all execution creditors
?	Exception under this section: If execution proceedings have been completely executed; there is judgment and it has been registered and have been completely enforced
?	The reason we’re talking about this is that the enforcement of all judgment is provincial law ? One bankruptcy is imposed, bankruptcy takes precedence over all provincial law
?	Where sheriff has seized property prior to bankruptcy: s.73(3)
-	S.71 ? Subsequent to a bankruptcy, all of the property of the bankrupt vesting in the estate (trustee) – except for the rights of secured creditors
-	Property not to be removed form province when bankruptcy order or assignment is issued: s.76
-	Effect on banking: s.78
?	Banker has to notify trustee
-	Impact on bankrupt: 18 separate duties found in ss.158-160
?	Failure to comply: Offence under s.198(2)
?	Bankruptcy offences found under s.198(1) 
-	Failure of bankrupt to disclose status of undischarged bankrupt: s.199
-	Failure to keep books and records: s.200

Bankruptcy Administration
-	Before first meeting of creditors, trustee must take preliminary steps:
?	S.16(3)
?	S.158
?	S.24
?	S.25
?	S.102
?	S.108
-	Any information that is relevant to the meeting of creditors, the trustee must obtain
-	Must put the information in a safe place
-	Must set up a trust account in a bank which to deposit $ for the estate
-	Within 5 days of being appointed, has to inform creditor and superintendent ? Within 21 days, has to set up first meeting and has to give at least 10 day notice to the creditors
?	Creditors also have to prove their claims
?	If bankrupt individual, trustee has to set out in the notice the situation of the bankrupt and any surplus payments that will be made out (This will be discussed later)
-	In meeting, inspectors are appointed and in that meeting, creditors can question the trustee an can ask questions they have about the bankrupt and the estate 
-	After this, there can be more meetings but the first meeting is very important ? Proof claims form, establish who the creditors are, etc. (Meeting that gets the ball rolling) 
-	When there’s a discharge, that only applies to individuals (b/c when there’s a bankrupt company it ceases to exist)
-	S.168.1 ? A first time bankrupt can get an automatic discharge after 9 months unless there are oppositions
-	If surplus payments ? 9 months to 21 months automatically discharged for first-time bankrupts

Property
-	In order for property to vest in the trustee, we have to know what the property is
-	Once bankruptcy, property of the debtor vests in the trustee ? This is property that debtor has at date of bankruptcy and what he acquires before discharge
-	Main question: What is the property of the bankrupt
?	Some property is exempt
?	Some pre-bankruptcy transactions will be set aside
-	 What is the property of the estate?
?	“Property”: s.2 (very broad) ? Read w/ s.71 (the vesting of property in the trustee) and s.67 (talks about what the property shall not comprise of and what it shall comprise of)
?	Property of the bankrupt shall not comprise of deeming property that is held in trust for someone else ? Unless common law rules of trust applies
?	(c) What it shall comprise of ? “Date of the bankruptcy”
?	After acquired property but before discharge
?	“Date of bankruptcy”: s.2 (contrast w/ “date of initial bankruptcy event”: s.2)
?	Two different dates are quite important when dealing w/ the bankrupt 
?	Date of bankruptcy definition is pretty clear but date of initial bankruptcy event is not all that clear

What is Property?
-	Licenses? Production quotas? (Permission to do certain things depending on what the quota relates to) See Saulnier ** Important b/c a licence can cost to purchase a lot of $$$ ? Licences are governed by regulatory regime 
?	Property in license?
?	Earnings from license?
?	Renewal/reissuance of license? 
-	Three approaches:
?	Regulatory

Saulnier
-	Determining property based on the legal framework
-	Starting point is statutory definition of property under the BIA (market value is not what we look at and doesn’t matter if it has no value)
?	Looked at s.67
?	Asked 3 questions 
-	CoA said we should have a beneficial interest approach ? There’s some property interest in the process of renewal of the licence and Mr. Saulnier gets to apply to renew his licence and gets to sign certain documents to get that renewal 
?	Although this is a limited interest you an still do it so this constitutes property interest ? He has certain rights and powers
?	Saulnier doesn’t have property in the licence but has beneficial interest in the earnings he is entitled to and that beneficial interest passes to the trustee
?	Renewal + resist to arbitrary denial of reissuance of the licence = Property rights of Sanulnier
-	Supreme Court
?	Problems w/ the supreme court’s approach 
?	Rejects commercial value approach ? Does not matter how much commercial value something has
?	Decided that property is property based on statutory interpretation 
?	Not an abstract concept
?	We have to interpret this in a purposeful way in an ordinary sense in accordance w/ the scheme of the Act 
?	According to common law, the licence is not considered a property 
?	First of all, how are we going to interpret this? 1) Overall purpose of the BIA Act; 2) What is the type of interest that is conferred by this legislation? If holding licence, you get to exploit that for a limited period of time but what does that licence allow you to do? Allows you to fish and once you have the fish, that becomes your property so you have property from the earnings (Mere licence to do what is otherwise illegal);
?	Primarily you have look at the legislation of what is before you 
?	SC preferred the preferred approach ? Permission to do what is otherwise unlawful; if you look at the statutes, the purpose and the definition, you find that it is intended to be completely encompassing (Anything that could fall under that definition)
Parliament wanted to sweep in every possible asset under the BIA which may not be normally considered property under the common law
?	So we need to respect that attention
?	Fishing licence is property here (“profit a prendre” = property in fishing licence) ** The reason this is problematic is b/c not every licence is going to give you a profit a prendre

2.4 Consequences of Bankruptcy
(a) Stay of Proceedings
Vachon v Canada (Employment & Immigration Commission)
Facts:
-	Appellant owed respondent Commission the sum of $922 when he made an assignment of his property under the BA
-	This sum of $922 was owed by appellant under ss.47 and 49 of the Unemployment Insurance Act; however, the debt has been incurred w/o fraud on the part of appellant, w/ the result that it was a debt from which he should normally be released by the order of discharge (s.148 of BA)
-	The claim of the Commission was a claim provable in bankruptcy and the Commission filed its proof of claim w/ the trustee
-	During the bankruptcy, when the Commission had not yet received anything from the trustee and appellant had not yet been discharged, unemployment insurance benefits became payable to appellant
-	Rather than paying appellant all the benefits owing to him, the Commission withheld the sum of $922 owed to it by appellant from these benefits

Legislation and Point at Issue:
-	S.49 of the Unemployment Insurance Act is what imposes on a claimant a duty to repay any overpayment and which provides the procedure for recovery, including in subs. (3) retention from subsequent payments, which respondent applied in the case at bar 
?	This method of recovering an overpayment, by retention from subsequent benefit, is a technique which is found in many statutes having a social purpose
-	The provision on which respondent’s principal argument is based is s. 47 of the Bankruptcy Act
-	Finally, the provision which is at the heart of the dispute is s.4991) of the Bankruptcy Act ? This provision is preceded by the subheading “Stay of Proceedings”

Issue:
-	The question that must be decided is the following: Does the recovery of an overpayment by retention from subsequent benefits, applied by respondent, constitute within the meaning of s.49(1) of the Bankruptcy Act a remedy against the debtor or his property, an action, execution or other proceeding which had been stayed except, as provided by this section, w/ leave of the Court or on such terms as the Court might impose?

General Nature of Stay of Proceedings Imposed by s.49(1) of the Bankruptcy Act
-	Appellant properly relied upon the English version of s.49(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, where the word recours is rendered by the word “remedy,” giving to it and to the words “autres procedures” (“other proceedings”) a very broad meaning which covers any kind of attempt at recovery, judicial or extrajudicial
-	Black’s Law Dictionary defines “remedy”:
?	The means by which a right is enforced or the violation of a right is prevented, redressed, or compensated
-	And below:
?	Remedy means any remedial right to which an aggrieved party is entitled w/ or w/o resort to a tribunal
-	Jowitt’s Dictionary of English Law gives an almost identical definition: 
?	The means by which the violation of a right is prevented, redressed, or compensated
?	Remedies are of four kinds: 1) by act of the party injured …; 2) by operation of law …; 3) by agreement b/w the parties …; 4) by judicial remedy, e.g. action or suit 
?	The last are called judicial remedies, as opposed  to the first three classes which are extrajudicial
-	The courts have also interpreted the stay of proceedings imposed by s.49(1) of the Bankruptcy Act very broadly ? The courts were right to give, expressly or by implication, a broad meaning to the stay of proceedings imposed by s.4(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 
?	This broad meaning is confirmed by the fact that the legislator took the trouble to exclude actions against either the creditor or his property
-	As Houlden and Morawetz wrote in Bankruptcy Law of Canada, under s.49 of the Bankruptcy Act:
?	An ordinary unsecured creditor w/ a claim provable in bankruptcy can only obtain payment of that claim subject to and in accordance w/ the terms of the Bankruptcy Act
?	The procedure laid down by that Act completely excludes any other remedy or procedure
-	The Bankruptcy Act governs bankruptcy in all its respects ? It is therefore understandable that the legislator wished to suspend all proceedings, administrative or judicial, so that all the objectives of the Act could be attained 
-	S.49(1) of the Bankruptcy Act is sufficiently broad to include recovery by retention from subsequent benefits, such as the recovery at issue here

S.49(1) of the Bankruptcy Act and the Immunity from Seizure of Unemployment Insurance Benefits 
-	Respondent relied that even if s.49(1) of the BA is so broadly worded so as to include an extra-judicial remedy or proceeding, such a remedy or proceeding is not a remedy or proceeding within the meaning of s.49(1) when its purpose is to recover property of the bankrupt which, in view of its immunity from seizure, does not fall within the fund available for its creditors, as provided by s.47 of the Bankruptcy Act 
?	Respondent submitted that s.49(1) of the BA must be interpreted in accordance w/ the principles underlying the Act, and what is in its submission the purpose or reason for the stay of proceedings imposed by s.49(1)
?	Respondent submits that, as unemployment insurance benefits are property which is immune from seizure, they are not part of the common fund available to creditors, and the retentions made by respondent did not have the effect of depriving the ordinary creditors of anything which belonged to the bankruptcy creditors’ common fund ? Such retentions cannot then be regarded as contravening s.49(1) of the BA
-	However, the interpretation suggested by respondent comes up against a major obstacle: w/o adequate justification, it rejects the method of grammatical or literal interpretation of a very clear provision
?	This interpretation suggest that words be added to s.49(1) of the BA, by interpreting the word “property” as referring to “property divisible among his creditors”
?	These words, which are contained in s.47, are not found in s.49(1) of the Act
?	That subsection uses only the word “property”, of which s.2 of the Act gives a broad definition not including the limitation in s.47
-	Respondent is thus asking the Court to make a distinction where the legislator makes none, and this prima facie is an error if interpretation
-	Respondent sought to justify this distinction in reliance on a fundamental objective of the Bankruptcy Act, namely, an equitable distribution of property to the creditors
?	First, it should be said that this is not the sole objective of the Act 
?	Industrial Acceptance Corp v Lalonde ? The purpose and object of the BA is to equitably distribute the assets of the debtor and to permit his rehabilitation as a citizen, unfettered by past debts
?	The rehabilitation of the bankrupt is not the result only of his discharge ? It begins when he is put into bankruptcy w/ measures designed to give him the minimum needed for subsistence
?	These measures are contained in s.47 of the Act concerning, inter alia, the exemption from execution of certain property, and in s.48, regarding the wages of the bankrupt, which applies notwithstanding s.47 and which empowers the Court to make an order directing the payment to the trustee of such part of the salary, wages or other remuneration as the court may determine having regard to the family responsibilities and personal situation of the bankrupt
?	The part of the wages paid to creditors does not necessarily correspond to the part which may be attached ? It may be more or less “having regard to the family responsibilities and personal situation of the bankrupt”
?	Houlden and Morawetz ? Since the enactment of s.48, wages have been removed from the operation of s.47 so that no pat thereof vests in the trustee to be divided among creditors unless he makes an application under s.48 and then only to the extent allowed by the court … Applications under s.48 of the Act come down not to a Q of law, but of fact; that is, whether the bankrupt after being given credit for his reasonable living expenses has excess funds which might be used to pay creditors
?	The appellant was right to see an analogy b/w the wages of a bankrupt and unemployment insurance benefits, and to argue that the partial or complete elimination of the latter may deprive the bankrupt of his means of subsistence, contrary to another objective of the Act
?	If the retentions from unemployment insurance benefits cannot be made w/o the Court’s authority, as specified in s.49(1), the Court will ensure that this other objective is not lost sight of
?	Moreover, the sole objective of the BA mentioned by respondent, namely an equitable distribution of the bankrupt’s property to his creditors, and the interests of the latter, will also be taken into account by the Court, to which the respondent will apply pursuant to s.49(1) for authority to recover the overpayment by retention from subsequent benefits 
?	The Court may grant such authorization, refuse it or grant it only in part or on certain conditions, taking all the circumstances into account 
-	In other words, the grammatical or literal interpretation of s.49(1) of the BA, which makes retentions from unemployment insurance benefits subject to authorization by the Court, is not an obstacle to pursuing any of the objectives of the BA ? On the contrary, it makes possible the coherent pursuit of those various objectives, under the supervision of the Court
-	It may be added that it will also have the effect of facilitating the administration of the bankruptcy by the trustee, who will thus automatically be informed of retentions made by creditors who have also filed claims in the bankruptcy 
-	Not only has respondent not shown any justification for an interpretation of s.49(1) of the BA other than the grammatical or literal one, but the latter is the only possible one in view of the general scheme of the Act

              R v Fitzgibbon
Issue: 
-	On the sentencing of an individual who is an undischarged bankrupt, can an order be made by a judge of the criminal court for the restitution of amounts acknowledged to have been defrauded or stolen from victims w/o giving notice to the trustee in bankruptcy and obtaining the consent of the bankruptcy court?
?	In other words, must consent be obtained from the bankruptcy court pursuant to s.49(1) of the Bankruptcy Act before a valid compensation order can be made pursuant to s.653 of the CC as part of the sentence pronounced against an undischarged bankrupt?

Analysis:
-	At the outset, something should be said of the nature of the compensation order and its place in sentencing as an integral and vitally important part of the criminal trial proceedings ? A TJ may, in the exercise of his or her discretion, order that compensation be paid to a victim of the convicted person 
-	Compensation orders are an extremely useful part of the sentencing procedure ? They are often used in sentencing young persons or first-time offenders who have not committed crimes of violence 
?	Their value cannot be over-emphasized 
?	Much of the efficacy of these orders is the immediacy of their effect
?	If it is possible, they deserve to available for consideration in the sentencing of all offenders 
?	It remains only to be determined whether the order could be validly made when the appellant was an undischarged bankrupt at the time of sentencing
-	The fact that the appellant is an undischarged bankrupt raises two issues:
1.	It was recognized in Zelensky that the means of the accused person should be taken into account when a court is considering making a compensation order ? However, the means of the offender should not in every case be the controlling factor
?	Here, the fraudulent acts of a lawyer directed at his own clients warranted the imposition of a compensation order even though the lawyer’s means at the time of sentencing were minimal 
?	The claims of the victims of fraudulent acts should be paramount
?	This seems to be recognized by s.148 (now s.178) of the BA ? This section provides that the discharge of a bankrupt does not release him from any debt or liability arising out of a fraudulent act committed by him while acting in a fiduciary capacity 
?	The BA itself, therefore, permits claims of fraud to survive the discharge of a bankrupt, and the fact that Fitzgibbon is an undischarged bankrupt should not allow him to avoid the imposition of this compensation order as part of his sentence
2.	It must be considered whether the compensation order could be validly made in light of the provisions of s.49(1) of the BA
?	The section prohibits the granting of any “remedy against” or “recovery of” any claim against the debtor or his property w/o leave of the court in bankruptcy 
?	The aim of the section is to provide a means of maintaining control over the distribution of the assets and property of the bankrupt ? In doing so, it reflects one of the primary purposes of the BA, namely to provide for the orderly and fair distribution of the bankrupt’s property among his or her creditors on a pari passu basis
?	The object of the section is to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings and to prevent any single unsecured creditor from obtaining a priority over any other unsecured creditors by bringing an action and executing a judgment against the debtor
?	This is accomplished by providing that no remedy or action may be taken against a bankrupt w/o leave of court in bankruptcy, and then only upon such terms as that court may impose
-	In contrast, a compensation order is an order made against the person of the offender, imposing upon him or her an obligation to pay the amount ordered ? It is only when the compensation order is filed w/ the Superior Court of the province that it becomes an order enforceable against the person and property of the offender 
-	There is a fundamentally important distinction b/w the original compensation order, which is an order against the person by which the court recognizes an acknowledged indebtedness, and the subsequent filing in the Superior Court which can covert that personal order into an order against the property of the accused
?	S.49(1) of the BA would preclude the enforcement of the latter 
?	This is b/c such an enforcement would result in the granting of the very priorities which the BA seeks to avoid 
?	However, the original compensation order made at the time of sentencing in an order against the offender personally recognizing an acknowledged indebtedness and is not immediately enforceable 
?	Until the order is filed w/ the Superior Court, it simply imposes a future obligation upon the offender to pay ? it is neither a remedy nor an order for recovery against the property of the bankrupt offender within the meaning of s.49(1)
?	Thus, s.49(1) does not prohibit the making of a compensation order
-	Compensation order can be made pursuant to s.653(1) w/o obtaining the consent of the bankruptcy order 
-	It is not until such time as the beneficiaries of the compensation order seek to proceed pursuant to s.653(2) and register the order w/ the SC of a province that they must first obtain the consent of the bankruptcy order

3. Property of the Estate
3.1 What is “Property”?
Introduction
-	The trustee’s main functions are: 1) to gather in and determine what assets belong to the estate; 2) where the assets are not already in liquid form, to collect any moneys owing to the estate and to realize the other assets by selling them piecemeal or as an entirety; and 3) to distribute the net residue of the estate in accordance w/ the creditor’s ranking under s.136(1) of the BIA 
-	S.71 provides that on the making of a receiving order or the filing of an assignment, the bankrupt ceases to have the capacity to deal w/ or dispose of his property and the property forthwith passes to and vests in the trustee 
-	“Property” is comprehensively but non-exhaustively defined in s.2 and covers all forms of property – real and personal, tangible and intangible, present and future, vested or contingent – whether located in Canada or elsewhere
?	However, subject to a variety of exceptions qualifications, the BIA does not specify what property rights the bankrupt in fact has at the time of bankruptcy that vest in the trustee
?	The Q is determined by provincial and other federal laws pursuant to s.72(1) 
-	This chapter deals w/ the following: 1) meaning of “property” in the context of ss. 67(1) and 71; 2) the secured creditor exception in s.71; 3) the claims of bona fide purchasers and the like to trust property (ss. 74, 75, and 99); 4) the trust property exception in s.67(1)(a); 5) the intersection b/w bankruptcy and family law; 6) sales (the pre-paying buyer); and 7) set-off (s.97(3))

Saulnier v Royal Bank of Canada
-	The appellants are correct to say that just b/c a “right” or “power” to fish has commercial value, it does not follow that licenses also constitute the property within the scope of the BIA or PPSA
-	Earlier trial decisions in Nova Scotia have held that fishing licenses were not property and were not claimable by the trustee in bankruptcy ? Cannot wish away the statutory language however much practical sense it reflected in the result reached by the courts below

A. A Q of Statutory Interpretation
-	The Q before the Court essentially raises a dispute about statutory interpretation
-	The notion of “property” is, in any event, a term of some elasticity and takes its meaning form the context 
-	The task is to interpret the definitions in the BIA and PPSA in a purposeful way having regard to “their entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously w/ the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament” (Driedger) 
-	Because a fishing licence may not qualify as “property” for the general purposes of the common law does not mean that it is also excluded from the reach of the statutes ? For particular purposes Parliament can and does create its own lexicon
-	In determining the scope of the definition of “property” in a statutory context, it is necessary to have regard to the overall purpose of the BIA, which is to regulate the orderly administration of the bankrupt’s affairs, keeping a balance b/w the rights of creditors and the desirability of giving the bankrupt a clean break
?	The exemption of designated property from distribution among creditors under s.67(1) is to allow the bankrupt to continue a living pending discharge and, when discharged, to make a fresh start 
?	Those exemptions do not bear much similarity to the proposed “exempting” of a valuable asset such as a commercial fishing licence ? If Saulnier had “sold” his licences prior to discharge the cash proceeds would, it seems, be after-acquired property that would be divided amongst his creditors under s.67(1)(c) of the BIA
-	Within this overall purpose an appropriate interpretation must be given to the following definition of “property” in s.2 of the BIA:
?	“Property” means any type of property, whether situated in Canada or elsewhere, and includes $, goods, things in action, land and every description of property, whether real or personal, legal or equitable, as well as obligations, easements and every description of estate, interest and profit, present or future, vested or contingent, in, arising out of or incident to property
-	The PPSA, on the other hand, is designated to facilitate the creation of a security interest to enable holders of personal property to use it as collateral, and to enable lenders to predict accurately the priority of their claims against the assets in question ? Within that overall purpose, an interpretation must be given to the somewhat circular definition given in s.2 of the PPSA
?	“Intangible” means personal property that is not goods, a document of title, chattel paper, a security, an instrument or money;
?	“Personal property” means goods, a document of title, chattel paper, a security, an instrument, money, or an intangible
-	Of course a creditor/lender who enters into a security agreement that is not registerable under the PPSA may still have contractual rights against the borrower ? However, the objective of lenders is to achieve priority (or to know in advance what priority they can achieve) over other claimants 
?	Otherwise a miscreant could enter into a series of unregistered financing agreement purporting to use and re-use the same boat and licence as collateral 

B. The Interest Conferred by a Fishing Licence
-	The fishery is a public resource ? The fishing licence permits he holder to participate for a limited time in its exploitation 
?	The fish, once caught, become the property of the holder 
-	Accordingly, the fishing licence is more than a “mere licence”  to do that which is otherwise illegal ? It is a licence coupled w/ a proprietary interest in the harvest form the fishing effort contingent, of course, on first catching it 
-	It is extremely doubtful that a simple licence could itself be considered property at common law ? On the other hand, if not property in the common law sense, a fishing licence is unquestionably a major commercial asset 
-	Despite a policy favouring stability and continuity, the Minister’s Commercial Fisheries Licencing Policy for Eastern Canada, 1996 seeks to guard against any notion that such licences should be read as conferring a property interest on licence holders, which could possibly impose a fetter on the exercise of the Minister’s “absolute discretion” in their issuance
?	The Minister’s statement of policy expresses a departmental position that has no regulatory status and which, in the eyes of the law, does not add to or subtract from his “absolute discretion” under s.7(1) of the Fisheries Act to issue licences
?	Nor does this informal policy determine whether the licence can be construed as “property” for the purposes of the BIA and PPSA 
?	The reality is that the commercial market operates justifiably on the assumption that licences can be transferred on application to the Minister w the consent of the existing licence holder, that licences will be renewed from year to year, and that the Minister’s policy will not be changed to the detriment of the existing licence holders
?	Thus, despite the Minister’s protestationsm the market attributes a high market value to what might otherwise be seen, as some of the cases put it, as a “transitory and ephemeral” right
-	The jurisprudence indicates a # of different approaches 

i) The Traditional “Property Approach” 
…
-	My point is simply that the subject matter of the licence (i.e. the right to participate in a fishery that is exclusive to licence holders) Coupled w/ a proprietary interest in the fish caught pursuant to its terms, bears a reasonable analogy to rights traditionally considered at common law to be proprietary in nature 
-	It is thus reasonably within the contemplation of the definition of “property” in s.2 of the BIA, where reference is made to a “profit, present or future, vested or contingent, in arising out of or incident to property” ? In this connection the property in question is the fish harvest 
-	Of course, the holder’s rights under a fishing licence are limited in time, place and the manner of their exercise by the Fisheries Act and Regulations 
?	To say that the fishing licence is coupled w/ a proprietary interest does not encumber the Minister’s discretion w/ proprietary fetters 
?	The analogy used for present purposes does not prevail over the legislation 
?	The licence is no more and no less than is described in the relevant legislation 
-	Nevertheless, during its lifetime, however fragile, the fishing licence clearly confers something more than a “mere” permission to do something which is otherwise illegal 

ii) The Regulatory Approach
-	The debate about the extent to which licences are “transitory and ephemeral” is of limited value  ? Uncertainties of renewal do not detract from the interest presently possessed by the holder, but nor does an exception of renewal based on a Minister’s policy which could change tomorrow, transform a licence into a property interest 
-	A difficulty w/ the “regulatory approach” is that there are no clear criteria to determine how much “fetter” on the issuing authority’s discretion is enough to transform a “mere licence” into some sort of interest sufficient to satisfy the statutory definition in the BIA and the PPSA
-	In any respect, agreed w/ the observation adopted by Major J in Comeau’s Sea Foods that he could not find in the fisheries legislation any legal underpinning for the “vesting” of an interest in a licence “beyond the rights which it gives for the year in which it was issued” ? To the extent that the regulatory cases are considered relevant here they do not assist the appellants
?	S.7(1) of the Fisheries Act says that the Minister’s discretion is “absolute”
-	Do not believe the prospect of renewal, whether or not subject to an “unfettered” discretion, is determinative
-	For present purposes the appellants do not have to prove a renewal or even the reasonable prospect of it 
?	The Q under the PPSA is whether the holder had a qualifying interest in the licence either at the time he entered into a General Security Agreement w/ the Royal Bank, or at the time the Bank sought to realize on Saulnier’s after-acquired property
?	The Q under the BIA is whether he had a qualifying interest within the meaning of the Act when he made an assignment in bankruptcy

iii) The “Commercial Realities” Approach
-	The criticism of this approach is that many things that have commercial value do not constitute property, while the value of some property may be minimal 
-	There is no necessary connection b/w proprietary status and commercial value
-	“Commercial realities” cannot legitimate wishful thinking about the notion of “property” in the BIA and the PPSA, although commercial realities provide an appropriate context in which to interpret the statutory provisions
-	The BIA and PPSA are, after all, largely commercial statutes which should be interpreted in a way best suited to enable them to accomplish their respective commercial purposes

iv) The Preferred Approach
-	The holder of a s.7(1) licence acquires a good deal more than merely permission to do that which would otherwise be unlawful ? The holder requires the right to engage in an exclusive fishery under the conditions imposed by the licence and, what is of prime importance, a proprietary right in the wild fish harvested thereunder, and the earnings from their sale
-	While these elements do not wholly correspond to the full range of rights necessary to characterize something as “property” at common law, the question is whether (even leaving aside the debate about the prospects of renewal) they are sufficient to qualify the “bundle of rights” the appellant Saulnier did possess as property for purposes of the statutes

(a) Fishing Licences Qualify as Property Within the Scope of Section 2 of the BIA
-	The terms of the BIA definition of “property” are very wide 
-	Parliament unambiguously signaled an intention to sweep up a variety of assets of the bankrupt not normally considered “property” at common law ? This intention should be respected if the purposes of the BIA are to be achieved
-	S.16 of the Regulations merely says that the Regulations contemplate that the documentation of the licence (as opposed to the licence itself) is the property of the Crown, in the same way that a Canadian Passport is declared to be the property of the Crown, not the holder 
?	A fisher whose licence is suspended or revoked cannot refuse the Minister’s demand for a return of the documentation on the basis the Minister gave it to him and it is now his property
-	Prefer to look at the substance of what was conferred, namely a licence to participate in the fishery coupled w/ a proprietary interest in the fish caught according to its terms and subject to the Minister’s regulation 
-	The BIA is intended to fulfill certain objectives in the event of a bankruptcy which require, in general, that non-exempt assets be made available to creditors ? Thus s.2 definition of property should be construed accordingly to include s.7(1) fishing licence 
-	It is true that the proprietary interest in the fish is contingent on the fish first being caught, but the existence of that contingency is contemplated in the BIA definition and is no more fatal to the proprietary status for BIA purposes than is the case w/ the equivalent contingency arising under a profit a prendre, which is undeniably a property interest
-	The licence is a creature of the regulatory system ? Section 7(1) of the Fisheries Act speaks of the Minister’s “absolute discretion” 
?	The Minister gives and the Minister (when acting properly within his jurisdiction under s.9 of the Act) can take way, according to the exigencies of his/her management of the fisheries 
?	The statute defines the nature of the holder’s interest, and this interest is not expanded by the court’s decision that a fishing licence qualifies for inclusion as “property” for certain statutory purposes
-	The trustee was entitled to require the appellant Saulnier to execute the appropriate documentation to obtain a transfer of the fishing licences to the third party purchaser 
-	If in the course of a bankruptcy the fishing licence expires, or has already expired, the trustee will have the same right as the original holder of an expired licence to go to the Minister to seek its replacement, and have the same recourse (or the lack of it) if the request is rejected
?	The bankrupt can transfer no greater rights than he possesses
?	The trustee simply steps into the shoes of the appellant Saulnier and takes the licence “warts and all”

(b) The Fishing Licence is Also “Personal Property” Within the Meaning of s.2 of the PPSA 
-	The PPSA definition of “intangible” simply describe something that otherwise constitutes “personal property” but is not one of the listed types of tangible personal property 
-	“Intangible” would include an interest created by statute having the characteristic of a licence coupled w/ an interest at common law as in the case of a profit a prendre 
-	DO not suggest that fishing licence constitutes a profit a prendre at common law, for clearly there would be numerous conceptual objections to such a characterization 
-	Our concern is exclusively w/ the extended definitions of “personal property” in the context of a statute that seeks to facilitate financing by borrowers and the protection of creditors 
-	The grant by the Fisheries Minister of a licence coupled w/ a proprietary interest as described above is sufficient to satisfy the PPSA definition
-	In this respect, the registration is therefore valid to include the s.7(1) fishing licence and, in the absence of any other PPSA defence, the respondent bank is entitled to proceed w/ its PPSA remedies  

Notes:
-	There are various reasons why it might be important to know whether an entitlement qualifies as “property” 
?	In some cases, the Q may determine the entitlement-holder’s right to exclude others from the entitlement 
?	In other cases, the Q may be whether the entitlement runs w/ the asset to which the entitlement relates so as to be enforceable against a transferee of the asset
?	In other cases still, the Q may be whether the entitlement is transferable
-	Saulnier was a case in this third category; the reason why it mattered to know whether the fishing licence qualified as property for the purposes of the BIA was to determine the trustee’s right to transfer the licence and generate value for the estate 
-	In Saulnier, the court held that the fishing licence was property for the purposes of the BIA even though it was transferable only w/ the approval of the licensing authority ? In other words, the case is at least indirect authority for the proposition that an entitlement may qualify as property even if there are restrictions on its transferability
?	Other cases point in the same direction 
?	As said, Saulnier suggests that an entitlement may be property for the purposes of the BIA even though its transfer is subject to the approval of a third party
?	Mulatz suggests that an entitlement may be property even though it is assignable only within a limited class of persons
?	And Charterier goes one step further by suggesting that an entitlement may be property even though it is assignable only to a specific individual 
-	Saulnier deals w/ statutory licences
?	Licences can also be granted by contract
?	A contractual licence is a form of agreement under which licensor A gives licensee B permission to use A’s property 
?	Licensing is a common method for the sharing of intellectual property rights 
?	S.84.1 ? Provides, in effect, that, subject to court approval, the trustee may assign a contract, whether or not the contract counterparty consents to the assignment 
?	One implication of this provision is that licence agreements (and other partly performed contracts to which the debtor is party) are “property” for the purposes of the BIA, at least in the sense that they are transferable
-	In Sittuk Investments Ltd, Spence J held that a time-share contract in a vacation resort was not a lease and did not give the holder a proprietary interest in the unit to which the contract relates, but only a personal entitlement
?	The upshot was that the time-share company’s trustee-in-bankruptcy was entitled to sell the property free of the holder’s interests
?	However, Spencer J went on to grant the time-share contract-holders relief on the grounds of unconscionability and estoppel 
?	The contracts had described the arrangements as “leases” and the time-share company had assured the holders that the contracts would not be adversely affected by any mortgage that might subsequently be placed on the property
?	In Sittuk, as in Saulnier, the question was framed in terms of whether the disputed entitlement qualified as property
?	In the Saulnier line of cases, the reason for asking the Q was to determine whether the entitlement vested in the trustee and, if so, whether the tustee could transfer it
?	By contrast, Sittuk, the reason for asking the Q was to determine whether the disputed entitlement (the time-share right) ran w/ the underlying asset (the time-share development) so as to bind successors in title of the time-share development owner
?	Sittuk is an example of the second type of case referred to in note 2
-	In Tucows.com Co v Lojas Renner SA, the court held that a domain name was “property” within the meaning of r.17.10(a) of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure ? The decision was based in part on the reasoning in Saulnier, and it is likely that the courts would similarly conclude that a domain name is property in the BIA context
-	S.30(1)(a) of the BIA provides that the trustee may, w/ the permission of the inspectors, “sell or otherwise dispose of such price or other consideration as the inspectors may approve all or any part of the property of the company” 
?	Can the trustee assign a legal cause of action?
?	The Q arises b/c of the rules against maintenance and champerty ? Maintenance is the giving of assistance to a litigant by a person who has no interest in the litigation and no legally valid motive for interference; Champerty is a particular kind of maintenance – namely, maintenance of an action in consideration of a promise to give the maintainer a share of the proceeds
?	Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd ? 1) A cause of action is a thing in action and so it is “property” within the meaning of BIA s.2(1); 2) BIA s.30(1)(a) authorized the trustee, w/ the concurrence of the inspectors, to assign the cause of action; and 3) the laws against maintenance and champerty do not apply to assignments that are authorized by law

Re Holley
Facts:
-	The appellant submitted that the bankruptcy court judge erred in finding that the cause of action referred to in the appellant’s action was property which vested in the trustee 

Analysis:
-	It is clear that where the damages for which the bankrupt asserts a claim are personal in nature whether it be for physical suffering resulting from physical injuries sustained as a result of the negligence of another person or mental suffering resulting from a libel or slander perpetrated upon him, such cause of action does not become the property of his trustee in bankruptcy b/c it is not the policy of the law to convert into $ for the creditors the mental or physical anguish of the debtor 
-	It is only after the nature of the damages, if any, to which the appellant claims to be entitled, has been ascertained, that the court can properly determine whether the cause of action is vested wholly or in part in the appellant or the trustee in bankruptcy ? Such question should be determined at trial

Notes:
-	What is the rationale for excluding certain causes of action from the property of the bankrupt? Beckham v Drake:
?	The creditors cannot legitimately have looked to the pain of the bankrupt from a broken limb, or wounded affection, or blasted character, as a source of profit, they being in their nature casual and unforeseen, and unconnected immediately w/ property 
-	The opposing objective is to maximize the debtor’s estate for the creditor’s benefit
-	In Re Holley, the court concluded that “it is only after the nature of the damages, if any, to which the appellant claims to be entitled, has been ascertained, that the court can properly determine whether the cause of action is vested wholly or in part in the appellant or the trustee in bankruptcy … The question is to be determined at trial
?	Who, then, is the proper P to bring the action – the debtor or the trustee? ? The answer seems to be either
?	If the debtor brings the action, she will have to account to the trustee for any damages, other than those for personal loss, recovered
?	Conversely, if the trustee brings the action, he will have to account to the debtor for the personal loss component of the damages award 
-	BIA s.68 deals w/ the debtor’s obligation to make contributions to the estate from surplus income earned during bankruptcy 
?	In Re Landry the Ontario CoA held that damages for wrongful dismissal are essentially compensation for unpaid wages and so they are equivalent to income 
?	S.68 is an exhaustive statement of the debtor’s obligation to make income contributions (Marzetti)
?	The consequence of the court’s ruling in Re Landry was, therefore, that the trustee could not claim the damages award under after-acquired property provision in s. 67(1)(c)
?	The 2009 amendments in effect codify the decision by making it clear that, for the purpose of s.68, “total income” includes “any amounts received as damages for wrongful dismissal”
-	A similar issue arises where the bankrupt is awarded damages for personal injury that include a component for lost wages and loss of future earning capacity 
?	In Re Anderson the court concluded that s.68 applied, to the exclusion of s.67(1)(c)
?	The court noted that “the bankruptcy laws are not meant or intended to require payments by the bankrupt to the estate after the bankrupt’s discharge. To require payment of any of the amount of future loss of wages to the estate would bring abou this result” 
?	In Re Mostajo, the court, w/o reference to Re Anderson, reached the opposite conclusion
-	 Marzetti establishes that s.68 takes precedence over s.67(1)(c)

Re Greenstreet Management Inc.
Facts:
-	The trustee, in the bankruptcy of the estate of Green Management Inc. moved for directions as to the entitlement, if any, of the estate of Greenstreet to the Deposit Proceeds which have been paid into court in an action as b/w Greenstreet and Bonnydon Ltd
-	Subsequent to the Deposit Proceeds being paid to court, Greenstreet made an assignment in bankruptcy ? The Trustee listed the Deposit Proceeds as an asset of the Estate and requested an order that they be paid out to the Trustee 

Analysis:
-	The property of a bankrupt that passes to the trustee is subject to all the equities and liabilities that affected it in the bankrupts’ hands and to all dispositions that had been validly made by the bankrupt ? In my view, once the Deposit Proceeds had been paid over to Bonnydon’s solicitors in trust, the Deposit Proceeds could no longer be considered property of Greenstreet in the absolute sense 
?	Pursuant to the terms of the APS and the Order of Master Haberman, Greenstreet had no unilateral right to obtain the Deposit Proceeds or to call for the return of the Deposit Proceeds 
?	The required ingredients for a trust – certainty of intention, subject matter, and object were present
?	As a consequence of establishing the trust, Greenstreet no longer had control over the Deposit Proceeds, and at no time prior to its bankruptcy did Greenstreet regain control over the Deposit Proceeds
?	Greenstreet had only a contingent interest in the Deposit Proceeds ? The interest that vested in the Trustee was this contingent interst, which does not give the Trustee the absolute right to the Deposit Proceeds
?	The Deposit Proceeds could only be returned to Greenstreet in the event of a finding of default by Bonnydon or by mutual consent of the parties 
-	The bankruptcy of Greenstreet did not change the situation ? The bankruptcy of Greenstreet does not elevate the Trustee to a position where it can claim the Deposit Proceeds w/o first obtaining a favourable outcome in the litigation
-	Prior to paying the monies out of court, it is necessary for the court to determine whether it was the default of Greenstreet or Bonnydon that resulted in the failure of the APS to close ? This finding will determine whether the Deposit Proceeds are property of the Estate or Bonnydon
-	The payment of the Deposit Proceeds into court did not operate so as to modify or amend the terms of the APS ? The Deposit Proceeds remained in court pending a determination of the parties ‘entitlement based on the terms of the APS and the law of vendor and purchaser
-	The trustee has a duty, as an officer of the court to act in an equitable manner to all parties ? This duty requires the Trustee to follow the same legal route that Greenstreet would have to follow in order to obtain the Deposit Proceeds
-	At the time of bankruptcy Greenstreet had a contingent interest in the funds ? The interest could only be realized if it obtained a favourable outcome in the action w/ Bonnydon, or otherwise resolved the matter w/ Bonnydon 
?	That is the same position that the Trustee finds itself in
-	The primary conclusion is the Trustee must be successful in the litigation before it can obtain the Deposit Proceeds 
-	The bankruptcy of Greenstreet does not in any way elevate the status of the Trustee to the point that it can use the bankruptcy process to dfeat the contingent interest that Bonnydon has in the Deposit Proceeds ? All factual elements required to resolve this litigation occurred prior to Greenstreet’s bankruptcy 
?	The bankruptcy process should not be utilized, in these circumstances, to determine the outcome
?	The outcome should be determined on the evidence surrounding the breach and the law of vendor and purchaser
-	The Deposit Proceeds were to remain w/ the Accountant pending final adjudication or further court order based on mutual consent

s. 2 “property” BIA, ss. 16(3)
ss.40, 67, 71, 80, 81 BIA

February 7, 2018
What is Property?
-	3 approaches: Regulatory, commercial realities, beneficial interest
-	SCC: Statutory interpretation (purpose of BIA, type of interest conferred); “preferred approach”
-	Judgment is open to interpretation that licence that has profit a prendre aspect is found to be property but licence with other aspects is still up in the air ? This was disappointment when the case came out
?	Earnings vs. taking something and that becoming your property
-	PPSA specifically says intangibles ? So Saulnier answers the Q is a licence specifically property?

Re Holley ** Pain and suffering of debtor is not up for creditors to grab
-	In this case the employer of the bankrupt was also the creditor of the bankrupt and opposed the discharge 
-	CoA concluded where damages the bankrupt is claiming is of a personal nature, that cause of action does not become the property of the trustee in bankruptcy b/c it’s not the policy of the law to convert into the money the mental or physical suffering of the debtor
?	Beckham v Drake 
-	Only after nature of damages, if any, to which the bankrupt claims to be entitled, is determined, then the court at that point can determine whether the cause of action vests wholly or partly in the trustee
-	Either can bring this cause of action ? IF the action is brought by the debtor and the debtor gets a settlement or an award that includes various heads, then the debtor is going to have to account to the trustee any damages that she gets that are ones other than personal damages, vice versa
-	For personal claims, it’s the debtor that gets to keep it 
-	Debtor is being restored personally as a result of the tort ? So this decision makes sense but there are varying opinions on this

Re Greenstreet Management ** When we should be determining what falls into the estate and what doesn’t
-	Issue: What is the nature of the deposit proceeds? 
-	Trust money does not vest in the trustee in bankruptcy and skimmed off the top of the estate ? Something held in trust doesn’t necessary mean they are trust $ not vesting in the trustee
-	Once that $250,000 was removed from the property of Greenstreet and was put in a trust account w/ this solicitor, Greenstreet can’t just recall that money and ahs been taken out of the power of Greenstreet and can’t go along with the Trustee’s submission right now and put that money into Greenstreet’s estate  
?	This is not $ which is held and can be immediately recalled by Greenstreet for no reason or for the claim that it’s alleging
-	Greenstreet had only a contingent interest in the Deposit Proceeds ? The interest that vested in the Trustee was this contingent interest, which does not give the Trustee the absolute right to the Deposit Proceeds
?	The Deposit Proceeds could only be returned to Greenstreet in the event of a finding of default by Bonnydon or by mutual consent of the parties
-	Trustee as officer of the court has to follow the same path that Greenstreet would have taken in order get the $ back ? Steps taken must be legal because that is the duty
-	Property of the estate is simply the property the bankrupt has ? If it’s contingent, then the trustee only gets a contingent interest and the Trustee doesn’t have a better title than the bankrupt

Trustee, PPSA and Secured Creditors
-	Trustee in bankruptcy, there are certain things that happen when it comes to secured creditors
-	PPSA is a provincial statute ? Regulates security interests (personal property, not abut land)
-	The rules for the creation of a security interest are dealt with under the PPSA and the PPSA provides a mechanism to determined priority b/w secured and unsecured parties and also determines priority b/w secured creditors and trustee of bankruptcy 
-	Secured creditors take before anyone else and don’t have to start litigation ? This is assuming however that the security interest is perfected
-	If a secured interest is not perfected, the secured creditor will not win out the trustee in bankruptcy and will just be added into pool of unsecured creditors upon bankruptcy
-	Attachment = Attachment of a security interest (Until attachment occurs, a secured creditor is not a secured creditor and is just a creditor)
?	1) Value has to be given; 2) Secured party obtains possession of collateral or Sa contains description of collateral AND; 3) Debtor must have rights in the collateral
-	Perfection = Security interest attached and all 3 steps required for perfection have been completed
-	When the BIA says secured creditor, it means perfected secured creditor ? An unperfected secured creditor loses out against the Trustee

Re Giffen ** s.136 = ‘subject to secured creditors’ means subject to perfected secured creditors
-	Facts ? Lessor seized vehicle from lessee before trustee got to it but then there are the proceeds of the sale that is being held in a trust account 
-	If you have something that is effectively a security interest as interpreted by the PPSA, then the person holding the security interest has to take certain steps to register and perfect that interest if that person wants to have that asset at the end of the day
-	Under the terms of the lease, once the PPSA/BIA kicks in, it’s not about ownership and ownership is irrelevant at that point ? s.67 of the BIA says ‘property of the bankrupt’ and it’s not about title at this point
-	Depends on a security interest, not who has title or who has ownership of the asset ? The Act will tell you who has the right to this asset
-	Lessor did not perfect its security interest ? Lessor will loose out to the trustee in bankruptcy
-	Bankrupt’s property’s will vest in the Trustee ? Right to use and possess the car (This is property under the BIA b/c it’s property under the PPSA)

Ford Credit
-	Creditors have to file a proof of claim ? Trustee says I need further documentation from you and don’t seize the vehicle from the debtor
-	S.203 creates an offence for any person, who within 30 days from filing a claim, removes or attempts to remove property from the bankrupt or trustee
-	S.81 says any person who claims property ahs to file a proof of claim with the trustee
-	Q ? Does a secured creditor who has a valid security interest, do they fall within the scope of s.81? Would that then allow the trustee to have that person charged under s.203?
-	S.81 does not apply to secured creditors ? Applies to bailment-like situations
?	This is the real owner of the goods claiming both possession and title
?	And you would file a proof of claim in this situation
-	A secured creditor has to follow a different procedure 
-	Secured creditor, if the secured creditor is seizing the asset, the secured creditor, what they have to do is to apply the terms of the agreement b/w the debtor and SC and there are aspects under the BIA, PPSA and common law that govern SC’s seizure
?	E.g. Notice, reasonable seizure
?	But CAN seize the property and does not have to go under s.81
-	Whoever seizes, whenever they seize there are certain exemptions from seizure
?	E.g. Trust property

Exempt Property & AAP
-	There are 3 stages:
?	How do you get there? Filing the assignment, having the petition filed against you = you become part of the bankruptcy scheme
?	When you’re in the middle of the bankruptcy scheme, you have to determine what is the property of the estate 
?	Reviewable transactions ? Trustee then starts to look at what other property can I bring into the estate?
-	There are exemptions to what constitutes property 
-	There is legislation that is designed to protect certain property from seizure of the trustee = s.67
?	The property that is exempt is subject to the laws of the province (s.67(1)(b))
-	Why do you get certain property getting exempt? When you have an honest but unfortunate debtor, and the purpose of bankruptcy is a fresh start, you can’t have that fresh start if every asset of theirs is seized ? Debtor and debtor’s family has to be able to meet their basic needs; personal and human dignity
?	Society also has an interest that if that debtor is thrown onto the streets, then society has to maintain that person
-	We give exemptions to individuals not corporations b/c they don’t need to maintain their human dignity or themselves or families
-	Even though all the property vests in the trustee, the trustee does not get exempt property
-	Property that is not exempt is not governed by the BIA, it’s governed by provincial law so the BIA incorporates by reference the provincial laws that determines what the exemption is
?	Parliament has left the scope for exemptions for each of the provinces
-	One of the problems with provincial laws is that they’re different amongst the provinces 
-	In Alberta, a debtor can claim a principal residence exemption of up to $40,000 ? Reason for this is historical ** Case law says you sell it and get the $40,000 from the sale 
-	If debtor’s primary occupation is farming, is entitled to 160 acres of land if that debtor’s residence is located on that land
-	Exemptions today has not kept up with today’s cost of living
-	Alberta = s.37 Regs
-	When can you determine the property is exempt and how much of it is exempt? The exempt status is determined at the date of bankruptcy and ‘date of bankruptcy’ is defined at s.2 of the BIA
-	What if debtor has sold assets that happened to be exempt? ? Is that $ exempt? No, unless the proceeds are also given an exemption
?	If you sell exempt property after, it’s up to you 
?	Why is this the case? If you do it after bankruptcy, you’re doing it to reorder your affairs 
?	The court has says that exempt status stays b/c a debtor is allowed to do whatever they can to ‘get a fresh start

Re Guest ** This is a problem with provincial exemption laws
-	Motor vehicle exemption ? This person was not employed but he volunteered at the local health authority
-	Court held van was not exempt; Must interpret legislation as it stands unfortunately

Re Gruber
-	At the time of the assignment, the bankrupt was in actual occupation of his home ? Then during the time of his bankruptcy, before discharge, he and his wife sold the home and generated net proceeds of $40,000 and the funds were used to support bankrupt and family during bankruptcy
-	S.67(1)(b) ? Property of bankrupt will not comprise of any property aht is exempt from execution or seizure; BUT (c) ? Will comprise of property acquired by bankrupt before discharge 
-	Once sold, trustee is arguing it leaves s.67(1)(b) and goes to (c)
-	S.71 is the vesting provision ? “All property passes to the trustee”
-	Whatever is claimed as exempt or whatever is given as exempt continues to be exempt throughout the bankruptcy ? Changing the form of the asset does not change the status (As this status has been given at the date of the bankruptcy)

3.2 Secured Creditors
-	BIA s.71 provides that when a debtor becomes bankrupt his property vests in the trustee, but subject to the “rights of secured creditors” 
-	BIA ss.69.3(1) and (2) provide that, when the debtor becomes bankrupt, no creditor has any remedy against the debtor or the debtor’s property, but, as a general rule, the debtor’s bankruptcy does not prevent a secured creditor from enforcing its security interest
-	S.127 provides that if a secured creditor enforces its security interest, it may file a proof of claim as an unsecured creditor for any shortfall b/w the value of the collateral and the debt ? Alternatively, a secured creditor may surrender its security to the trustee and claim as an unsecured creditor for the whole debt
-	Sections 136 and following set out the rules for distribution of the estate among creditors who have filed a proof of claim
-	S.136(1) provides that these rules are “subject to the rights of secured creditors”
-	Read together, these provisions mean that, generally speaking, a secured creditor has priority over unsecured creditors in a debtor’s bankruptcy 
-	The provincial property security laws (PPSAs) create an exception by providing that an unperfected security interest is ineffective against the debtor’s trustee in bankruptcy ? In other words, the secured creditor must take steps to publicize its security interest, typically by taking possession of the collateral or registering a finance statement, if it wants the priority the BIA gives it

Re Giffen
Facts:
-	Lessor leased a car to BC Telephone Company; which in turn leased the car to one of its employees, the bankrupt ? The lease gave the bankrupt the option of purchasing the vehicle from the lessor
-	Although the lessor was not a party to the agreement, it played an important role in the arrangement contemplated by the agreement
-	Bankrupt made an assignment in bankruptcy
-	Neither the lessor nor the BC Telephone Company had registered financing statements under the PPSA in respect of their leases ? Their failure to register meant that the lessor’s security interest in the car was not perfected, as defined in the PPSA, at the time of the assignment in bankruptcy
-	The appellant was appointed as the trustee in bankruptcy ? The lessor seized the vehicle and sold it w/ the trustee’s consent 
?	Proceeds were held in trust by the lessor’s counsel 
-	The trustee subsequently brought a motion for an order that it was entitled to the proceeds of sale relying on s.20(b)(i) of the PPSA ? The lessor opposed the claim on the grounds that the bankrupt never owned the car and that the trustee could not have a better claim to the car than the bankrupt had

Issue:
-	The principal question raised by this appeal is whether s.20(b)(i) of the PPSA can render a lessor’s unperfected security interest in personal property ineffective against the rights acquired in the property by the trustee in bankruptcy, which finds its authority under the BIA

Held:
-	S.20(b)(i) operates on the present facts, to defeat the unperfected security interest of the respondent, in favour of the interest acquired by the appellant 

Analysis:
-	This issue can be resolved through a normal reading of the relevant provisions of both the PPSA and the BIA, buttressed by the policy considerations supporting these provisions
-	The CoA did not recognize that the provincial legislature, in enacting the PPSA, has set aside the traditional concepts of title and ownership to a certain extent
-	Buckwold and Cuming:
?	Property rights of persons subject to provincial legislation are what the legislature determines them to be
?	While a statutory definition of rights may incorporate common law concepts in whole or in part, it is open to the legislature to redefine or revise those concepts as may be required to meet the objectives of its legislation 
?	This was done in the provincial PPSAs, which implement a new conceptual approach to the definition and assertion of rights in and to personal property falling within their scope 
?	The priority and realization provisions of the Acts revolve around the central statutory concept of “security interest”
?	The rights of parties to a transaction that creates a security interest are explicitly mot dependent upon either the form of the transaction or upon traditional questions of title ? Rather, they are defined by the Act itself
-	In International Harvester, the Saskatchewan CoA recognized that the regime put in place to regulate competing interests in personal property does not turn on title to the collateral:
?	There is nothing in the language of the section [s.20], or its relationship w/ other sections, or indeed in the overall scheme of the Act to suggest, for e.g., that an unperfected security interest, b/c it is rooted in and attached to the title of particular goods in the possession of a debtor, should be treated as superior to the more generally deprived and broadly attached interest which an execution creditor comes to have in a debtor’s goods
?	Indeed, the very opposite is suggested not only by the language of the section, but by the overall thrust of the Act
-	This dispute cannot be resolved through the determination of who has title to the car b/c the dispute is one of priority to the car and not ownership in it ? In this context, the PPSA must be given its intended effect 
-	The PPSA applies “to every transaction that in substance creates a security interest, w/o regard to its form and w/o regard to the person who has title to the collateral” (s.2(1)(a))
-	S.1 of the PPSA define “security interest,” in part, as “an interest in goods, chattel, paper, a security, a document of title, an instrument, $ or an intangible that secures payment or performance of an obligation” ? This definition is elaborated upon by para 1(a)(iii) of the PPSA, which provides that “security interest” means the interest of “a lessor under a lease for a term of more than one year, whether or not the interest secures payment or performance of an obligation” 
-	Further s.3 of the PPSA deems certain agreements, which do not secure payment or performance of an obligation, to be security agreements for the purposes of the PPSA ? S.3 includes leases “for a term more than a year that do not secure payment or performance of an obligation”
-	The elements of definition of “security interest” explicitly include within the definition of “security interest” leases for a term of more than one year ? The lessor’s interest in the car is the reservation of title in the car; this interest, created by the lease agreement, falls within the ambit of PPSA
-	A security interest is valid and enforceable when it attaches to personal property
?	S.12(1)(b) of the PPSA provides that a security interest “attaches” when the debtor acquires “rights in the collateral”
?	S.12(2) states explicitly that “a debtor has rights in goods leased to the debtor … when he obtains possession of them in accordance w/ the lease”
-	Thus, upon delivery of the car to the bankrupt, the lessor had a valid security interest in the car that could be asserted against the lessee and against a third party claiming aright to the car ? However, the lessor’s security interest remained vulnerable to the claims of third parties who obtain an interest in the car through the lessee including, trustees in bankruptcy 
?	In order to protect its security interest from such claims, the lessor must therefor perfect its interest through registration of its interet (s.25), or repossession of the collateral (s.24) 
?	The lessor did not have possession of the car, and it did not register its security interest
?	Thus, prior to the bankruptcy, the lessor held an unperfected security interest in the car ? This brings us to the BIA
-	S.71(2) of the BIA provides that, upon an assignment into bankruptcy, the bankrupt’s “property … shall, subject to this Act and to the rights of secured creditors, forthwith pass to and vest in the trustee” ? s.2 of the BIA defines “property” very broadly to include “every description of estate, interest and profit, present or future, vested or contingent, in, arising out of or incident to property”
?	The court opined that the bankrupt’s right to use and possess the car constituted “property” for the purposes of the BIA and the trustee, by virtue of s.71(2) of the BIA, succeeds to this proprietary right 
-	The trustee assumes the bankrupt’s possessory interest in the car through the operation of s.71(2); it is upon this basis that the trustee can assert a claim to the car
-	The Sask CoA explained the theory behind s.20 of the Sask PPSA in International Harvester ? A person w/ an interest rooted in title to property in the possession of another, once perfected, can, in the event of default by the debtor, look to the property ahead of all others to satisfy his claim; However, if that interest is not perfected, it is vulnerable, even though it is rooted in title to the goods
?	A third party may derive an interest in the same goods by virtue of some dealing w/ the person in possession of then, and … he may become entitled to priority
?	That is, he may become entitled, ahead of the person holding the unperfected security interest, to look to the goods to satisfy his claim
-	Public disclosure of the security interest is required to prevent innocent third parties from granting credit to the debtor or other wise acquiring an interest in the collateral ? However, public disclosure of the security interest does not seem to be required to protect a trustee who is in the position of an innocent third party; rather, the trustee succeeds to the interests of the bankrupt
?	In one authority’s opinion, trustees are given the capacity to defeat unperfected security interests b/c of the “representative capacity of the trustee and the effect of bankruptcy on the enforcement rights of unsecured creditors”
-	Prior to a bankruptcy, unsecured creditors can make claims against the debtor through provincial judgment enforcement measures ? Successful claims will rank prior to unperfected security interests pursuant to s.20
-	Once a bankruptcy occurs, however, all claims are frozen and the unsecured creditors must look to the trustee in bankruptcy to assert their claims
-	Cuming describes the purpose of s.20(b)(i):
?	In effect, the judgment enforcement rights of unsecured creditors are merged in the bankruptcy proceedings and the trustee is now the representative of creditors who can no longer bring their claims to a “perfected” status under provincial law
?	As the repository of enforcement rights, the trustee has status under s.20(b)(i) of the BCPPSA to attack the unperfected security interest
-	The purpose behind granting a trustee in bankruptcy the power to defeat unperfected security interests was recognized by the Sask CoA international Harvester:
?	Indeed, the fact that a trustee in bankruptcy is a representative of creditors serves to shed light on more than one aspect of the issue 
?	It explains – or at least assists w/ the explanation of – why a trustee in bankruptcy is included in s.20, as well as why a trustee is not necessarily confined to the interest of the bankrupt
-	The Sask CoA again acknowledged the representative role of the trustee in bankruptcy in Paccar Financial Services:
?	The court stated that the trustee after bankruptcy acts as the representative of the unsecured creditors of the bankrupt and asserts “the claim of the unsecured creditors to the goods and possessions of the bankrupt pursuant to the priorities established for competing perfected and unperfected security interests. It is simply a contest as b/w an unsecured creditor and the holder of an unperfected security interest”
-	CoA erred in not recognizing that the purpose of s.20(b)(i), is, at least in part, to permit the unsecured creditors to maintain, through the person of the trustee, the same vis-à-vis secured creditors who have not perfected their security interests which they enjoyed prior to the bankruptcy of the debtor 
-	On a plain reading of s.20(b)(i), the lessor’s interest in the car is ineffective against the trustee
-	S.20(b)(i) does not grant title or any other proprietary interest to the trustee, but it prevents the lessor from exercising rights against the trustee ? Admittedly, the effect of s.20(b)(i), on the present facts, is that the trustee ends up w/ full right to the car when the bankrupt had only a right of use and possession
?	Fleeming/Flintoft ? Trustee in bankruptcy cannot succeed to property held on trust by the bankrupt; This principle appears to be the source of comments made in Fleeming and Flintoft to the effect that a trustee in bankruptcy cannot take a greater interest than the bankrupt had 
?	The bankrupt in the case at bar did not hold the car on trust for the lessor
-	Accept that there is a principle which provides that a trustee in bankruptcy cannot obtain a greater interest to the goods than the bankrupt (beyond the context of a trust where the goods are not property of the bankrupt ? However, s.20(b)(i) itself modifies that principle
?	Cases have consistently accepted that s.20(b)(i), or its equivalent, can give the trustee a greater interest in the disputed property than that enjoyed by the bankrupt
-	Title could not defeat the trutsee’s claim under s.20(b)(i) of the PPSA, but does the lessor’s retention of title and the principle of nemo dat quod non habet prevent the trustee from selling the car, conferring clear title, and distributing its proceeds under the BIA?
?	S.81 of the BIA provides a procedure through which third parties can file claims w/ the trustee against “property … in the possession of a bankrupt at the time of the bankruptcy”
?	S.81(2) provides that where the trustee disputes a claim, and the claimant does not appeal within the prescribed time period, then the claimant is “deemed to have abandoned or relinquished all his right to or interest in the property to the trustee who thereupon may sell or dispose of the property free of any lien, right, title or interest of the claimant”
?	S.81 does not specifically deal w/ the circumstances where a claimant’s claim is defeated, but presumably the trustee would be able to sell the goods free of the claim
-	The lessor could have made a claim under s.81 of the BIA ? This claim would have been defeated by the trustee in reliance on s.20(b)(i) of the PPSA
-	Both the defeat of a claim and the failure to make a claim under s.81 result in the effective abandonment or relinquishment of any claim to the car; the trustee can therefore sell the car and confer good title
-	S.136 of the BIA sets out a priority scheme for the division of the property of the bankrupt; the interests of the various creditors are all “subject to the rights of secured creditors” 
-	S.67 describes which constitutes the property of the bankrupt 
-	This Court has held on a # of occasions that provincial legislatures cannot enact legislation which operates to interfere w/ the priority of distribution set out in the BIA, nor can they confer secured creditor status on a class of creditors not entitled to such status under the BIA
-	S.20(b)(i) of the PPSA does not offend the priorities set out in the BIA; rather, s.20(b)(i) is but one element of the provincial legislation which serves to define the rights of the parties involved in a bankruptcy ? More particularly, s.20(b)(i) serves, on the present facts, to define the rights of the lessor and indicates that for the purpose of the bankruptcy, the lessor does not have the status of a secured creditor
-	Even though bankruptcy is clearly a federal matter, and even though it has been established that the federal Parliament alone can determine distribution priorities, the BIA is dependent on provincial property and civil rights legislation in order to inform the terms of the BIA and the rights of the parties involved in the bankruptcy ? s.72(1) of the BIA contemplates interaction w/ provincial legislation
-	S.20(b)(i) does not reorder federal priorities ? Compliance w/ the perfection requirements of the PPSA is a precondition to maintaining secured status under the BIA 
-	In the event of bankruptcy, the consequences of a failure to perfect are spelled out in s.20(b)(i) ? In effect, the secured party w/ an unperfected security interest becomes an unsecured creditor of the bankrupt

Notes
-	Re Giffen concerns the interaction b/w the BIA and the PPSAs ? The PPSAs govern secured transactions, or “security agreements”
?	A security agreement is an agreement that gives the creditor a security interest in personal property belonging to the debtor 
?	The PPSAs apply to all transactions that in substance create a security interest, regardless of form
?	This means they cover not just transactions that create security interests in the strict sense (the mortgage, the pledge, and the charge), but also transactions that are functionally equivalent to mortgage, charge, and pledge agreements (E.g. Conditional sale agreements and a goods lease for a term of more than one year)
?	There are different kinds of leases
?	One kind is the simple contract of hire ? In cases like this the customer has the use of the goods for the period of the agreement and returns them to the lessor when the time is up
?	Another kind of lease is the finance lease ? This is an in-substance security agreement; it is functionally equivalent to a conditional sale
?	The customer pays rent for an agreed period but, unlike the simple contract of hire, the parties do not anticipate that the customer will ever return the goods to the lessor
?	Rather, the agreement either expressly or tacitly gives the customer a right to purchase the goods for a predetermined price at the end of the term 
?	In principle, the PPSAs should apply to a lease if it in substance secures payment or performance of an obligation, but not otherwise ? However, this distinction is sometimes a hard one to draw and, to avoid litigation, the statutes are expressed to apply to all leases that are for a term of more than one year, the length of the term being a proxy for inquiry into the substance of the transaction
-	Given the secured creditor’s privileged position in the debtor’s bankruptcy, why don’t all creditors take security?
?	A security interest is not cost-free
?	The secured creditor must pay a price, usually in the form of a lower interest rate than it could demand w/o security
?	The lower interest rate reflects the secured creditor’s reduced risk
?	These cost considerations imply that the Q might just as sensibly be put the other way around – that is, why do creditors ever take security? 

Re Fields
Facts;
-	James Fields filed an assignment in bankruptcy 
-	At the date of the bankruptcy, DCFS was a creditor of Fields pursuant to a conditional sale contract made b/w Fields and DCFS in respect of a 1998 Chrysler Intrepid 
-	It is conceded that DCFS has not perfected its security interest in Ontario
-	It is also agreed that the vehicle has a present worth of at least $11,000
-	DCFS filed a proof of claim w/ the trustee, claiming a balance owing pursuant to the conditional sale contract ? By notice of disallowance, the Trustee disallowed the Proof of Claim of DCFS 
-	Mr. Fields did not claim any exemption for the subject 1998 Chrysler under the Ontario Execution Act
-	In the Statement of Affairs, the vehicle was shown as non-exempt property
-	Further, Mr. Fields specifically waived his claim for such exemption in a waiver 

Issue:
-	Whether the Trustee has any interest or claim to the bankrupt’s motor vehicle up to the amount of $5,000, in light of the applicable sections in the Execution Act and the BIA ? AKA does the exempt status of the bankrupt’s property prevent the trustee from enjoying priority over DCFS’s unperfected security interest
Analysis:
-	In Perron-Malenfant v Malenfant (Trutsee of), the SCC considered the interplay of the BIA and a provincial Execution Act ? The court stated that where a province enacts rules governing seizability, those express rules govern 
?	This case thus stands for the proposition that this court must look to the specific wording of the Ontario Execution Act to determine whether the exemption applies b/c under s.67(1)(b), it is the particular province’s statutes concerning exemptions that dictate the rights of debtor, creator, and trustee 
?	The BIA sets out the rules of the game ? The Ontario Execution Act “informs” the BIA; it is the “code” to be applied
-	S.2(b) is clear in its language ? In order for a motor vehicle to be exempt, it must have a value not exceeding $5,000
?	No other meaning can be given to these words 
?	Thus the vehicle in question does not qualify for an exemption as it has an admitted value of at least $11,000
-	Thus, find that there is no exemption for the vehicle in question ? This finding effectively disposes of this appeal

BUT IN THE CASE THAT I’M WRONG
-	The bankrupt waived the exemption in this case ? Issue is whether a creditor can claim the exemption
-	Wholeheartedly agree w/ Justice Berger (dissent) in the Direct Rental case that “there is no policy or principled reason to confer upon a creditor who has failed to meet the requirements of the PPSA for perfecting its security interest, an advantage over other unsecured creditors” ? Accept the assertion that the purpose of the exemption is to assist a bankrupt in an attempt to re-establish him- or herself 
?	There is no rationale for the creditor to be able to claim an exemption
-	Also note that Ontario Execution Act makes provision for the debtor to make choices about the exemption 
?	S.3(2) provides that the debtor may, in lieu of the chattels referred to in s.2(4), elect to receive the proceeds of the sale thereof up to the prescribed amount 
?	S.6 gives the debtor (and family members) the right to select out of the # of chattels exempt from seizure
?	Agree w/ assertion of counsel for Trustee that, if the legislature had intended that creditors be able to claim the exemption if the debtor chose not to, or to include the right to select among exempt property, it could have enacted provisions to this effect
-	Carefully reviewed “western” jurisprudence cited by counsel for DCFS, but do not feel constrained to follow same 
?	Alberta’s CEA provide for a distribution scheme recognizing secured creditors, if the value of the exempted property exceeds the prescribed maximum for the exemption (s.89 of the Alberta CEA)
?	Alberta’s CEA specifically allows a bailiff to make selections of property if the debtor does not do so (s.90) 
?	The Ontario Execution Act has no such provisions
-	Additionally, find support for conclusion that the creditor DCFS cannot claim the $5,000 exemption for the motor vehicle in question in the review of the conflicting lines of authority as set out in the majority decision in the VW Credit case ? Justice Roscoe found, given the direction of the SCC in Re Giffen, that the statement in the lower court decision in the Direct Rental case, that “provincial legislature cannot make “non exempt” that which the federal gov’t has made “exempt”, questionable
-	 Third prong of Trustee’s agreement, that is, that there is no exemption for a purchase $ security interest:
?	This argument is premised on the interplay of s.7(1) of the Execution Act and s.67(1)(b) of the BIA
?	The effect of s.7(1) of the EA is that an exemption would not apply to prevent the holder of a purchase $ security interest from seizing its collateral ? Thus, outside of bankruptcy, there would be no exemption for the vehicle as against DCFS
?	However, s.67(1)(b) of the BIA refers to “any property that as against the bankrupt is exempt from execution or seizure” 
?	By virtue of s.7(1) of the Execution Act, there was no exemption w/ respect to the car as of the date of the assignment in bankruptcy
?	The BIA does not create exemptions 
-	Find for Trustee on third prong of argument, that is, there is no exemption for a particular money security interest

Secured Creditors’ Claims 
A. Introduction
-	One of the fundamental principles of Canadian bankruptcy law is that only the property of the bankrupt is made available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of the bankrupt ? A trustee in bankruptcy therefore has no right to confiscate the property of a third party, notwithstanding that it may be in possession or control of the bankrupt
?	This principle applies even if the third party has only a limited proprietary right in the property, as opposed to full ownership of it
?	This explains the treatment of secured creditors in bankruptcy
?	Secured creditors have a limited proprietary right in the debtor’s property, which gives them the right to enforce their claims against the collateral in the event of default
-	The proprietary right of a secured creditor is largely unaffected by a bankruptcy of the creditor ? Upon default, the secured creditor may enforce the security interest through seizure and sale of the property or through foreclosure of the security interest
?	A secured creditor thereby withdraws the asset from the bankrupt estate 
?	If there is a surplus after the secured creditor and any subordinate interests are satisfied, it must be paid over to the trustee in bankruptcy
?	If there is a deficiency (the proceeds from the sale of the collateral are insufficient to satisfy the obligation secured), the secured creditor may prove for it as an ordinary unsecured creditor in the bankruptcy of the debtor 
?	The trustee in bankruptcy has only a limited ability to interfere w/ the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security
-	There is an exception to the principle that the rights of a secured creditor are largely unaffected by a bankruptcy
?	Provincial law may provide that certain registration or perfection requirements must be established in order for a security interest to have priority over a trustee in bankruptcy 
?	Provincial personal property security legislation provides that an unperfected security interest is subordinate to a trustee in bankruptcy
?	The SCC in Re Giffen upheld the constitutionality of these provisions 
?	Provincial statutes governing real property do not contain equivalent provisions that subordinate an unregistered interest in land to at trustee in bankruptcy ? A secured creditor is therefore able to enforce its security against the trustee in bankruptcy despite its failure to register its interest in a land titles or land registration system

B. Definition of Secured Creditor
-	The definition of secured creditor in BIA s.2 is of pre-Personal Property Security Act vintage and raises 2 important questions:
1.	Does it cover security interests not enumerated in the definition – for example, conditional sales and some types of equipment leases; and
2.	Does it include non-consensual security interests arising by operation of law and not by agreement?
-	So far as the first Q is concerned, in R v Ford, Austin J assumed almost as a matter of course that the definition in s.2 includes conditional sales ? He was right not b/c the inclusion of conditional sales is implicit in the enumeration of security interests in the definition, but b/c serious practical difficulties would otherwise arise in applying the BIA provisions governing the enforcement of security interests 
?	This Q, however, is not clear-cut
-	The answer to the second question is clearly “yes”, although there is surprisingly little authority that states this explicitly ? The reasons for this construction are that the definition of secured creditor is not confined to consensual claims, b/c it expressly covers liens, and that the term “charge” is wide enough to encompass non-consensual security interests created by statute
?	A repairer who as a common law possessory lien therefore qualifies as a secured creditor, as would a person who is entitled to claim a statutory lien on goods pursuant to legislation such as the Repair and Storage Liens Act or the Garage Keepers’ Lien Act
-	A landlord’s distress for unpaid rent originally qualified as a secured claim b/c it gave the landlord an interest akin to a lien on the goods ? However, in 1949, the Bankrupt Act was changed and the landlord was instead afforded the status of a preferred claimant 
?	Any property that had been seized under a distress for rent had to be turned over to the trustee, unless the process had been fully completed by payment to the landlord before the occurrence of the bankruptcy (ss. 73(4) and 136(1)(f))
?	The courts held that these changes indicated that Parliament intended that landlords were no longer to be treated as secured creditors in bankruptcy proceedings
-	Although provincial judgment enforcement law may provide that a writ or other judgment enforcement process creates a lien or charge on the property or confers on it the same priority as a secured creditor, this will not give the creditor the status of a secured creditor in a bankruptcy ? S.70(1) of the BIA provides that a bankruptcy order or assignment takes precedence over all judgment enforcement proceedings except those that have been completely executed by payment to the creditor
-	Although statutory liens and charges in favour of the Crown qualify as secured claims and give the Crown the status of a secured creditor, the Crown’s ability to assert such claims in a bankruptcy has been restricted by ss. 87-88 of the BIA ? Notwithstanding that statutory deemed trusts have essentially the same function as statutory liens and charges, they are afforded different treatment under the BIA
?	A person who has the benefit of a statutory deemed trust is not regarded as a secured creditor under Canadian bankruptcy law 
?	The courts have treated the holder of the claim as a beneficiary of a trust ? However, s.67(2) and (3) of the BIA have greatly restricted the ability of the Crown to assert such claims in a bankruptcy

C. Enforcement of Security Interests
-	BIA s.69.3 establishes the basic principle that the general stay of proceedings consequent on the debtor’s bankruptcy does not apply to secured claims unless the court imposes a stay at the trustee’s request ? Even then the stay can only be of limited duration and is rarely granted in practice
?	However, there is an unresolved conflict in the case law where a secured creditor may engage in self-help in repossessing the collateral or whether it must file a proof of claim and comply w/ the requirements in BIA s.81
-	In addition to these provisions that apply only in bankruptcy proceedings, s.244 of the BIA limits the ability of a secured creditor to enforce the security ? The secured creditor must give the debtor a 10-day notice before enforcing a security on all or substantially all the inventory, accounts receivable, or other property of the debtor
?	This limitation applies outside the bankruptcy context as well, and frequently arises when a secured creditor appoints a privately appointed receiver
-	Assuming that the secured creditor has seized or realized the collateral after the debtor’s bankruptcy, BIA ss. 127-130 then come into play to determine the trustee’s and secured creditor’s rights 
?	If there is a deficiency in the amount owning to the secured creditor after the collateral has been realized, s.127 allows the secured party to file a proof of claim for the balance
?	However, in the case of an individual debtor, any unpaid balance will be discharged upon the debtor’s discharge from bankruptcy under s.169 or 172

R v Ford Credit Canada Limited
Facts;
-	Considers respective rights of a secured creditor and a trustee in bankruptcy
-	S.69.3(1) of the BA stays proceedings against a bankrupt
-	S.69.3(2) says, in effect, that s.69.3(1) does not apply to secured creditors 
-	S.203 makes it an offence, in certain circumstances, to take property from the bankrupt or the trustee 

Issue:
-	Whether s.203 applies to secured creditors ? More specifically, whether s.203 applies to property in the possession of the bankrupt which is security for a debt of the bankrupt

Analysis:
-	One of the matters discussed on the argument of this appeal was whether Ford’s interest was proprietary or security
?	The distinction arises from the different language used in ss.69.3(2) and 81(1)
-	S.69.3(2) refers to a “secured creditor” dealing “ with his security” 
-	S. 81(1) on the other hand deals w/ the situation “where a person claims any property, or interest therein, in the possession of the bankrupt”
?	It is clear that s.81 is intended to deal w/ a bailment situation (e.g. where a person leaves his suit w/ the drycleaner and the drycleaner goes bankrupt) ? Whether it applies to more than bailments need not be decided here
?	S. 81 sets out a code or procedure to be followed in those circumstances 
?	The claimant was file a proof of claim
?	The trustee may allow it or dispute it ? If disputed, the claimant may appeal; if he does not, he is deemed to have abandoned the property
?	The onus of establishing a claim is on the claimant 
?	S.81 provides the only method of determining such a claim
-	It is clear that the procedure to be followed where a security claim only is made is quite different ? In the event of a dispute, the trustee’s recourse is not to give notice of disallowance but to apply to the court for directions (s. 81 does not provide an exclusive procedure for this situation)
-	This difference in procedure raises the Q whether Parliament intended s.81 to have any application at all where a security interest only is claimed ? Having regard to the language of s.69.3(2) and of s.81, it would appear that Parliament did not
-	On its face, s.69.3(2) indicates that s.81 does not apply
?	S.69.3(2) says that w/ certain exceptions, a secured creditor may deal w/ its security as if this section has not been passed
?	“This section” refers to s.81(1)
?	The “certain exceptions” are set out in s.79 and ss.127-134
?	S. 81 is not even mentioned in s.69.3(2) ? On a plain reading of s.69.3(2), therefore, it is not subject to s.81 
?	Since s.203 is only applicable to property or property interest referred to in s.59, it would appear that s.203 is not applicable to security
-	S.79 deals w/ property of the bankrupt held by another as a pledge, pawn or other security ? In such a case, the trustee may inspect the property and redeem it 
?	On receipt of notice from the trustee, the holder is not to realize the security until the trustee has had an opportunity to inspect it, and if he wishes, to redeem it 
?	That section to applicable as the property was in possession of Mrs. Szucsko at time of bankruptcy 
-	Ss.127-134 are under the heading “Proof by Secured Creditors”
?	S.127(1) says that where a secured creditor realizes his security, he may prove (as an ordinary creditor) for the balance of the debt
?	S.127(2) provides that where the creditor surrenders his security to the trustee, he may file a proof of claim for the whole amount of his claim
?	S.127 has no application to the present circumstances
?	S.128 provides that where a secured creditor neither realizes nor surrenders his security, he shall, if the trustee so demands, value the security ? If he does this, he is entitled to share in the bankruptcy only to the extent that his claim exceeds the stated value of the security; The trustee, for his part, may accept the creditor’s valuation and may redeem the security if he so wishes
?	S.129 deals w/ the situation where the secured creditor has failed to value his security or the trustee is not satisfied w/ the creditor’s valuation ? In either of those events, the trustee may require that the security be put up for sale
?	S.130 empowers the creditor to require the trustee to elect whether he is going to redeem or require a sale
?	Ss.131 and 132 deal w/ amending the valuation of the security
?	S.133 provides that if a secured creditor does not comply w/ ss. 127-132, he shall be excluded from any dividend
?	S.134 provides that subject to s.130, a creditor shall not receive more than 100 cents on the dollar, plus interest
-	S.81 should be limited to the cases where the claimant has only a proprietary interest; the person who left his suit w/ the drycleaner would be an example, as would the man leaving his vehicle w. the garage operator for repairs 
-	Where the claimant has a security interest, either in isolation or together w/ a proprietary interest, then he can rely on his security interest ? In this event, he can exercise his rights under s.69.3(2) and need not proceed under s.81 
-	A reason for drawing a distinction b/w the assertion of a proprietary right and the assertion of a security right lies in the different requirements of a trustee in those two situations 
?	In the case of the suit left w/ the drycleaner who went bankrupt, the trustee would be entitled to the cost of the cleaning, if it had been done, nothing more 
?	In the case of the assertion of a security interest, however, the trustee must be concerned about the value of the security, whether it will yield $ in excess of the claim of the secured creditor, or whether on the other hand there will be a deficiency and a claim by the creditor for that deficiency
?	To met these exigencies, the trustee is given the powers and duties set out in s.79 and in ss.127-134
?	To meet the circumstances of a purely proprietary claim, the trustee is given the powers and duties set out in s.81
-	Would read into s.203 that it does not apply to property in the possession of a bankrupt which is security for a debt of the bankrupt ? To do otherwise is to make s.69.3(2) subject to s.203 and to do that is to import into s.69.3(2) the code of procedure set out in s.81
?	That is entirely contrary to the apparent objective of s.69.3(2)
-	Ford was a secured creditor
?	Was bund to observe the requirements of ss.69.3(2), 79 and 127-134
?	Was not bound to observe the requirements of s.81 ? B/c s.81 did not apply, neither did s.203
3.3 Exempt Property
A. General Considerations and Purposes of Exemption Law
-	s.67(1)(b) of the BIA provides that the trustee is entitled to all of the debtor’s property w/ the exception, inter alia, of property exempt from execution or seizure under any laws applicable in the province within which the property is situated and within which the bankrupt resides
-	Investors Group Trust Co v Eckhoff ? “The purpose of exemptions legislation is to ensure a minimum asset base for execution debtors so as to keep them from having to seek social assistance” 
-	Saulnier v RBC ? “The exemption of designated property from distribution among creditors under s.67(1) is to allow the bankrupt to continue a living pending discharge and, when discharged, to make a fresh start”

Thomas GW Telfer, “The Proposed Federal Exemption Regime for the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act”
-	Exemption statutes permit the debtor to retain some essentials or what has been called the “basics of life while making the bulk of his or her asserts available to satisfy judgment creditors” ? However, recent reform proposals suggest that a broader view should be taken of a necessity
?	Existing provincial exemption statutes, however, reflect a traditional concern to protect a minimal level of existence 
?	Under the general category of necessities many provincial exemption statutes include such items as household furniture, wearing apparel, food and fuel
?	Some jurisdictions recognize a motor vehicle as a basic necessity up to a fixed dollar amount 
?	A debtor’s basic necessity may also include shelter and some jurisdictions provide some form of exemption for residential property 
?	However, there is no consensus among the provinces and territories on the scope of the residential property exemption or whether such an exemption should exist at all
-	A second major theme of exemption statutes involves preserving the means for debtors to “survive and to earn a living, thus contributing to their rehabilitation as citizens and to their capacity to repay their debts” 
?	Debtors should not be “deprived of an immediate means of livelihood”
?	To accomplish this goal, exemption statutes protect items of personal property, such as tools of trade or agricultural implements, which assist a debtor in earning an income
?	Within this livelihood rationale, some provinces exempt farmland 
?	Preserving the economic vitality of the debtor has been justified from the broader perspective of the public interest
?	If creditors were permitted to “destroy debtors’ economic viability, their continued maintenance would fall to society” 
?	Exemptions are said to shift the burden of support for the debtor from the “public to private credit sources” ? Debtors should not be “cast upon the community w/ nothing, penniless w/ the likelihood of becoming a public charge”
-	Finally, exemption statutes minimize the judgment debtor’s loss that may occur through forced execution sales
?	While the exempt property may be of value to the debtor, many of the debtor’s personal possession may yield little value at a sheriff’s sale and in turn may impose considerable hardship on the debtor
?	Some provincial statutes protect items of sentimental value

B. The Choice of Provincial Law for Federal Bankruptcy Exemptions
-	The drafter of the Canadian Bankruptcy Act chose to incorporate provincial exemption legislation to determine the types and values of property that would be exempt in a bankruptcy
-	As a result, bankruptcy exemptions vary widely among the provinces ? In particular, the western provinces are much more generous in their homestead and farmstead allowances than the other provinces 

Thomas GW Telfer, “The Evolution of Bankruptcy Exemption Law in Canada 1867-1919: The Triumph of the Provincial Model”
-	Although the US Bankruptcy Act of 1898 may have been an influence, there are several other explanations that explain the policy choice to incorporate provincial exemptions laws into the Bankruptcy Act in 1919
-	First, the provincial model found in the 1919 Act was consistent w/ provisions found in the earlier Canadian bankruptcy legislation and bills which pre-dated US Bankruptcy Act of 1898
-	Second, and perhaps more importantly, the diversity of provincial exemption laws precluded the adoption of a uniform bankruptcy exemption regime in 1919 
?	Personal property exemption lists varied from province to province both in terms of value and types of property exempted
?	Additionally, the existence of generous homestead exemptions in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta and the absence of similar regimes in other provinces would have made it difficult for HP Grundy to draft some kind of comprise acceptable to each region 
?	Beyond the statutory differences, a review of the case law reveals further regional differences and approaches to the interpretation of exemption statutes ? Reconciliation of the provincial lists would have been nearly impossible
-	If American law had any influence in Canada it was state homestead exemption statutes that provided a ready model for the Canadian western provinces of Manitoba, Sask and Alberta ? However, Canadian provinces did not copy US state homestead law as a matter of convenience 
?	The three western provinces were in a competition for immigrants w/ states to the south
?	W/o such a homestead exemption north of the border ther was a fear that immigrants would avoid the Canadian west and favour the US
?	The homestead exemption became a necessity in the Canadian west 
-	Thus when HP Grundy began to draft the 1919 Act, he was not dealing w/ a clean slate, at least when it came to exemptions ? The starting point for Parliament in 1919 was the odd and diverse provincial law that had been enacted at various times and in response to various needs

C. Personal Insolvency Task Force Recommendations
-	The PITF felt the current disparities among the provincial exemption statutes were too great and that, at a minimum, all Canadian personal bankrupts, wherever situated, should be able to avail themselves at their option of a set of federal exemptions

Personal Insolvency Task Force, Final Report
-	There is a wide disparity among the provinces and territories with respect to the type of property that are exempt from seizure by the debtor’s creditors, and therefore also exempt from seizure in bankruptcy, and the value of the property that is exempt
-	These results conflict w/ the general theory of Canadian bankruptcy law, which proceeds from the premise that bankrupts and their creditors should be treated alike regardless of the residence or place of business of the debtor or the debtor’s creditors 
-	The Task Force concluded that a more modest approach is called or at the present time and that individual bankrupts should be able to opt for a list of federally prescribed exemptions in place of the otherwise applicable provincial or territorial exemptions ? In this way the BIA will ensure that all bankrupts will have access to what is regarded as a reasonable set of exemptions regardless of the bankrupt’s place of residence or weaknesses and gaps in the provincial or territorial legislation
-	The recommendations of the Task Force are as follows:

D. Time for Determining the Exempt Status of Property
-	Time for determining the exempt status of property is at the date of bankruptcy ? If the debtor has sold an exempt asset prior to the bankruptcy, the debtor will not be able to claim ane emption in respect of the proceeds unless the proceeds are also given an exemption status by the applicable exemption law 
-	In most provinces, a voluntary sale or other disposition of an exempt asset will result in the loss of the exemption 
-	However, if the transfer was an involuntary one, as in the case of a forced sale by a secured creditor, the proceeds were affored an exempt status
-	In Alberta and Nfl and Labrador, if the proceeds of a sale of exempt property are not intermingled w/ other funds of the detor, they themselves are exempt for 60 days from the date of thes ale
-	If a bankrupt acquires an assert after the date of the bankruptcy, the determination of its exempt status is made at the time that the bankrupt acquired it 

E. Consequences of Disposition of Exempt Assets
-	In most provinces, a voluntary disposition of an exempt asset, absent a bankruptcy, will cause the loss of the exempt status in respect of the proceeds of sale in the hands of the debtor
-	What principle applies when there is a disposition in bankruptcy?

Re Gruber
Facts:
-	The Bankrupt made an assignment in bankruptcy to which, Deloitte was appointed as Trustee
-	At the time of his Assignment, the bankrupt claimed as exempt his interest as joint tenant of certain real property 
-	At the time of the Assignment, the bankrupt was in actual occupation of this property
-	While still an undischarged bankrupt, the bankrupt and his wife sold their home generating a net sale of proceeds after payment of realtor’s commission, legal fees, etc. of approx. $40,000
-	These founds have subsequently been used by the bankrupt and his wife to support himself and his family during his bankruptcy 
-	Sale of the property also was motivated in part from threats of foreclosure proceedings due to the mortgage on the property being substantially in arrears 
-	The concern that arises in this case appears to flow from the fact that notwithstanding that the Bankrupt was under considerable pressure to resolve the Q of arrears on his mortgage he entered into what might be considered a voluntary sale rather than a forced sale and whether those circumstances change his entitlement to an exemption w/ respect to the net proceeds of the sale

Analysis:
-	It is noted that s.1(1)(k) of the Exemptions Act requires that in order for the house for which exemption is claimed to be exempt from seizure under a writ of execution, the house must be actually occupied by the execution debtor 
-	There is clear case authority & it flows from the wording of the Exemptions Act that, absent bankruptcy, if the debtor abandons his occupation of the property or sells same, the Exemptions Act no longer applies to the proceeds of same and same may be subject to attachment by his execution creditors
-	Case authority is clear that the effective date for determination of the status of the exemption occurs on the date of bankruptcy 
?	At that date the Bankrupt’s property was severed into two estates: one estate that vests w/ the Trustee and is divisible amongst the Bankrupt’s creditors, and one that remains w/ the Bankrupt b/c it is exempt under provincial law 
?	It should be noted that the Trustee may acquire other property of the Bankrupt if it consists of property that may be acquired by or devolve on the Bankrupt before his discharge as set forth in s.67(c) of the Bankruptcy Act
-	Subscribe to view espoused in Re Pearson and Pannell Kerr MacGillivray Inc. v Beer that once an assignment in bankruptcy has been made, the determination of the property of the bankrupt which is assigned to the trustee and the property to which he can claim an exception is made, as of the date of the assignment
?	Property that may come into the hands of the bankrupt after the date of the assignment into bankruptcy may well properly flow through to the trustee in bankruptcy as property of the bankrupt estate 
?	However, am not satisfied that those decisions dealing w/ exempt assets losing their exemption have any application whatsoever in case of a bankruptcy
?	If the determination of the division of property is made as of the date of bankruptcy, provisions of the Exemptions Act are on longer applicable after that date 
-	In general terms, the intent of the BIA is, inter alia, to allow a bankrupt to reorganize his affairs and in due course be discharged from bankruptcy, and hopefully to maintain a solvent position thereafter ? It surely could not have been intended that where a bankrupt is forced by financial constraints to sell an exempt asset in order to support his family or otherwise that he should lose that exemption even if the sale is voluntary, and thus be penalized for attempting to reduce his expenses to the benefit of his creditors
-	An asset which is validly exempt at the date of bankruptcy remains exempt, notwithstanding the nature of any subsequent dealings w/ that asset
-	Bankrupt was entitled to the exemption of his interest in his home at the date of the bankruptcy as he was in actual occupation, and the equity was less than $40,000 ? The fact that he subsequently sold that property prior to his discharge, does not affect his entitlement to one-half of the net proceeds of that sale as exempt property 
-	Bankrupt’s interest in the net sale proceeds from his home which was claimed exempt at the date of his Assignment but subsequently sold by him in property exempt and does not comprise an asset of his bankrupt estate

February 12, 2018
-	What if the stuff you have is worth more than what’s stipulated under the exemptions secton?
?	Some exemptions are absolute 
?	Only if the value of property is less than what the exemption says, then the debtor will be able to keep the property
?	If property over maximum value, it can be sold ? Whatever is exempt is given to debtor and whatever is over is given to trustee
-	When should valuation of exemption take place?
?	This will become relevant if you have partially exempt property that increase in value after bankruptcy ? Who is entitled to that increase?
?	Valuating at date of bankruptcy vs. when trustee deals w/ property 
?	Predominant view is the latter

Re McKay
-	A bankruptcy isn’t a one-day affair ? The legal assignment of bankruptcy is the start of a legal process that continues for some time
-	At the administration stage, the trustee needs to decide what to do with the property 
?	So the trustee may decide that realizing the value of surplus equity should happen before the application of discharge 
-	If the value of the property is below the maximum exempt value, trustee may decide to disclaim the interest and re-vest the interest to the bankrupt ? What this means is the trustee must decide on a course of action for the time of valuing the property 
?	Cannot wait indefinitely 
?	Has to make a decision at some point 
-	Alternatively, you can have a surplus value ? This will be taken into account when discharge happens
-	S.170 ? Requires trustee to prepare a report w/ respect to the affairs of the bankrupt…
?	This report gets filed w/ the court 
?	
-	There’s a certain valuation on exempt assets ? Doesn’t matter if entire asset is exempt but if there’s a maximum value exemption, there’s a Q as to when that property is to value
-	No hard and fast rule regarding when the trustee has to do that ? Just one: Trustee has to deal w/ asset as of the time of discharge
-	If a conditional order for discharge is given and it requires the bankrupt to pay for the surplus equity, nobody can later ride the market and re-visit that 

Secured Credit & Exemptions 
-	Due to security interests, are the exemptions illusory?
-	In Alberta, a secured creditor can claim its security interest in an exempt asset

Monteith
-	After acquired property that’s exempt 
-	Regardless of when the bankrupt acquires exempt property, the exempt property does not form part of the bankrupt’s estate to be distributed to creditors
-	Not about the date which the property is acquired that’s important, but it’s the status itself 

RRSP Exemptions
-	To provide future income to people
-	S.67(1)(b.3)

After Acquired Property (AAP)
-	Recall wording of s.67(1)(c) “…before his discharge”
?	The problem is: 1) if bankrupt enters into transactions with third parties (s.99) ? Transactions made in good faith
?	S.99 is designed to act as a shield for third parties who deal w/ a bankrupt and who deals w/ a bankrupt in good faith ? There’s this protection in place b/c third parties shouldn’t be losing property they acquired from that bankrupt b/c they acted in good faith and for value
?	Even though after acquired property does vest in the trustee under s.67, practically, the bankrupt has the right to possession of that possession and the right to disposition of that property until the trustee intervenes
?	So what happens b/c date of possession and date of intervention if the bankrupt decides to deal with that property?
?	What is meant by good faith? ? Fisher Case (Not in readings)
?	Course of business was regular in this case, except for the effect of bankruptcy & the D had no knowledge of the bankruptcy
?	Trustee sought to recover the after acquired property & D is not covered under s.99
?	Court said as long as you provided value for the property you are dealing in good faith ? s.99 is focused entirely on the third party and not on the bankrupt so if third party acted in good faith, it will suffice
?	Good faith implies that the third party is really a purchaser and it’s not taking a conveyance for another purpose, nominal consideration, gift, etc. ? This is true purchaser 
?	Court said if there is nothing objectionable about these transactions, we’re not going to overturn them 
?	Slightly different if third party knew about the bankruptcy & tried to get a better deal ? This was not present in Fisher
?	S.99 applies when there is a transaction with a third party but it may arise in other situations as well
?	It’s a very specific situation where s.99 would apply 
-	If the bankrupt is an individual, the vesting of after acquired property occurs after that bankrupt is granted a discharge ? After the discharge, those assets do not vest in the trustee (this is qualified, of course)
-	If bankrupt has been discharged and if bankrupt acquires property at that point, creditors cannot come after the bankrupt
-	Policy reasons: If you owe student loans, alimony, child support, then these debts are not affected 
?	If you do something wrong (Fraud, sexual assault, not disclosing to trustee)
?	If someone’s depending on you
-	Creditors cannot look to assets that are acquired after the discharge except for those under s.178

Surplus Income (Another aspect of AAP)
-	Surplus b/c it’s more than what’s needed for debtor’s maintenance ? In short, creditors will get it 
-	Does this fall under s.67(1)(c) ? If it does, it means that upon bankruptcy, that surplus income will immediately vest in the trustee and the trustee gets to distribute amongst creditors
-	If falls under s.68 ? There’s an entire code that deals w/ how to deal with surplus income
-	Recall wording of s.67(1)(c)
-	What happens if there are wages after the date of bankruptcy? Are the wages of the bankrupt part of the property of the estate and captured under s.67?
-	What is surplus income? Amount of total income of an individual which exceeds the amount needed for a debtor’s maintenance

Wallace
-	Issue arises w/ does Wallace have the ability to pursue this claim or is the claim property of the estate?
-	S.2 ? Claim falls under the definition of property b/c the definition is broad enough 
-	S.71(2) deals with any order/assignment made under the authority of this act ? If you look at this and s.67 anything vests in the trustee
-	Court says provisions say the bankrupt doesn’t have the ability to deal w/ this action BUT if you look at s.99 the bankrupt can reply on it b/c s.99 allows the bankrupt deals w/ after acquired property
?	CoA said this but SC rejected this
?	Apart from a very narrow exception in s.99, the bankrupt actually loses his ability to pursue his claim ? Unless another excemption applies
?	S.67 ? Property can be categorized as salary, etc. …
-	SC at para. 59 says an discharged bankrupt can bring a claim against its employer ? Not b/c of timing in question but because of nature
-	Para 65 ? Underlying nature is essentially wages and wages do not immediately vest in the trustee 
-	If falls under s.67, it immediately vests but b/c of s.68 it doesn’t immediately vest ? s.68 acts as an exception to s.67
-	The trustee can determine what is surplus after the bankrupt’s wages are earned and that part of the salary is what is divided amongst the creditors

Exempt Property and Valuation Issues 
-	Provincial exemption legislation may exempt certain types of property regardless of value, or the legislation may specific that some types of property will be exempt up to a maximum dollar value 
-	Generally, property exceeding that capped amount is available to creditors 

Re McKay
Facts:
-	This is an application by CIBC for the order that the bankrupt pay $21,375 to it, which is what the bankrupt netted above his $20,000 exemption when the co-owned principal residence was voluntarily sold some time after the date of bankruptcy

Analysis:
-	In Alberta exemptions are a matter of legislation, either by the Legislature acting within its constitutional jurisdiction or by Parliament acting within its constitutional jurisdiction ? The most common Alberta legislation relevant to exemptions is the Civil Enforcement Act, although it is not the only Alberta exemptions legislation
-	In a bankruptcy the bankrupt’s property passing to the trustee falls within 3 general classes:
1.	Property which is not exempt;
2.	Property which is wholly exempt regardless of its value;
3.	Property which the bankrupt has a limited exemption for
-	The first class needs no explanation
-	The second class of property is where the legislation gives an exemption w/o a quantitative limit ? If property is wholly exempt regardless of its value there is no need to debate at which point in time it should be valued for exemption purposes
?	That which is wholly exempt regardless of value remains wholly exempt 
?	The value of wholly exempt property is simply not relevant for realization purposes b/c the trustee is prohibited from realizing on it 
-	The third class of property is that for which the bankrupt has a limited exemption ? The most commonly run across in both bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy cases is property identified in s.88 Civil Enforcement Act
-	Do not accept that the relevant value of limited exemption property for realization purposes should be its value at the date of bankruptcy to give bankrupts immediate certainty
?	A bankruptcy is not a one day circus w/ the finale being at the end of the day
?	An assignment is a start of a legal process which will continue for some time 
?	Only time will spell the finale
-	The only certainties for a bankrupt at the date of bankruptcy are:
1.	He has assigned all his property to the trustee;
2.	His unsecured creditors cannot proceed against him w/o leave of the Court;
3.	When he exits the bankruptcy he can keep that which the law says its exempt
-	At the “estate-administration stage” of the bankruptcy the trustee cannot exercise his distribution powers to use that which is exempt for the benefit of the creditors 
-	But that which is exempt is the “maximum exemption” set out in the Regulation ? The trustee is not required to transfer back to the bankrupt more than that and the bankrupt is not entitled to get more than that
-	Nobody says that there need not be a cut-off date for dealing w/ the issue posed before the court ? Agree that the bankrupt should not be left to twist in the wind indefinitely
-	A trustee can realize for the surplus equity in limited exemptions property before the bankrupt’s application for discharge ? The trustee can also decide to deal w/ that on the bankrupt’s application for discharge of he considers that to be the best time and best method for realizing on the surplus (Again, this is a practical decision by the trustee)
-	It is not uncommon for a trustee to wait until the bankrupt’s application for discharge to deal w/ the surplus equity ? Conditional orders of discharge are sometimes a practical and effective means to deal w/ a surplus equity in property, be it land or chattels
-	There are advantages to surplus equity being realized that way:
?	First, the trustee must do a s.170 report and he makes recommendations about what order is appropriate ? If he recommends a conditional order of discharge for the surplus equity proved creditors might not be as opposed to the bankrupt’s discharge 
?	Second, a conditional order is a cost effective method of realizing on the surplus equity
?	Third, a bankrupt who wants to keep the property and pay a reasonable price for the surplus equity may not presently have the $ to do it ? Instead of adjourning the application for discharge until the bankrupt is able to pay and has paid the conditional order gives a present finality, which is necessary at some point 
?	In effect, the bankrupt buys now on time
?	The conditional order can even be ordered to be charge against the property and be registered as such
-	The trustee is not the only person who can ask for a conditional order of discharge as a way to realize on the surplus equity in property ? Proved creditors have a status to ask for that 
?	If a trustee declines to realize on surplus equity prior to the application for discharge or declines to ask for a conditional order of discharge, creditors have a right to pursue surplus equity in a timely manner 
?	It is not uncommon for creditors to appear on applications for discharge and submit that the bankrupt should not be unconditionally discharged
-	If a surplus equity has not been realized on by the trustee, creditors who want realization have two options:
1.	First, they can appear at the application for discharge and ask for a conditional order for payment of the surplus equity ? If that is given, the surplus equity is shared b/w all proved creditors
2.	Alternatively, a creditor can get a s.38 order in a timely manner to let it realize for the surplus equity and if it gets the order and does realize on the surplus equity it does not have to share w/ other creditors
-	At the estate-administration stage, the trustee deals w/ limited exemption property ? He cannot use that which is exempt for the benefit of creditors
?	If the trustee has not dealt w/ limited exemption property prior to the bankrupt’s discharge, the discharge is to be considered as an estate-administration stage for that property 
?	This brings finality for all
?	Viewing the discharge as part of the estate-administration stage for dealing w/ wholly exempt or limited exemption property fits within the second stage of the Ramgotra analysis
-	Regardless whether a bankrupt has gotten an absolute, suspended or conditional discharge nobody can later raise an issue about surplus equity in a house ? The discharge is the latest time that the issue is to be dealt w/, if anyone wants to make that an issue
?	If a conditional order is given requiring the bankrupt to pay for the surplus equity nobody can later ride the market, up or down, to revisit that
?	If the house value later goes up the trustee and creditors cannot ask that the bankruptcy now pay more 
?	If the house value later goes down the bankrupt cannot ask that he now pay less
-	There is nothing in the Court record showing that the bankrupt’s equity in the house was an issue at any time prior to the discharge or at his application for discharge ? CIBC did not raise an issue about the bankrupt’s equity in the house until some months after the conditional order of discharge and only after the house was sold some months after the conditional order of discharge 
?	It is too late
-	The message to trustees and creditors is – advance claims for surplus equity in limited exemptions property by no later than the bankrupt’s application for discharge, or forget it

Non-Purchase Money Security Interests in Exempt Personal Property
-	If the debtor has given a creditor a pre-bankruptcy security interest in exempt property, in general, provincial law does not prevent the secured party from enforcing its security interest ? This is true where the secured party holds a purchase money security interest in the chattel
?	E.g. Provincial exemption law will not prevent a dealer or banker that has financed the purchase of a motor vehicle from repossessing the vehicle after the debtor’s bankruptcy 
?	This is generally (though not uniformly) regarded as a fair result
?	However, the position may be viewed very differently if the secured party holds a non-purchase money security interest in exempt property
-	Many of the provinces now make non-purchase money security interests in exempt property unenforceable ? The PITF recommended the inclusion of a provision to deal w/ non-purchase money security agreements in the BIA to ensure uniform treatment of bankrupts across Canada

RRSP Exemptions in Bankruptcy 
Personal Insolvency Task Force, Final Report
-	The federal gov’t has made a policy favouring retirement savings ? The rationale for this policy choice is the importance of encouraging Canadians to plan for their retirement, so as to promote individual financial responsibility and to ensure that senior citizens do not become solely reliant on the public purse 
?	The policy choice is evidenced by the exempt status afforded to Registered Pension Plans available to employed Canadians, through significant tax incentives available both for RPPs and RRSPs, and through the prohibition against lenders taking security against RRSP investment
-	While pensions are “inexigible”, meaning they are entirely exempt from creditors’ claims, RRSPs vary in the extent to which they are exigible
?	Conventional RRSPs held by banks, brokerages or self-directed funds are fully exigible through execution and in bankruptcy
?	Insurance-type RRSPs, held by provincially-regulated insurers in the form of annuities, are exempt under certain circumstances, primarily where the designated beneficiary is the spouse, parent or child of the holder of the RRSP
?	Locked-in RRSPs, created when ex-employees withdraw from pension plans upon termination of employment after the pension rights have vested, are exempt under pension legislation and cannot be accessed until retirement
-	Only a small proportion of bankrupts have RRSPs among their assets at the time of filing
-	As a result of treatment of RRSPs, employees w/ pension plans can safely accumulate exempt retirement savings but self-employed individuals and non-pensioned employees normally lose their RRSP investments upon bankruptcy, even though their contributions may have been made many years before their insolvency
-	The existence of the exempt insurance-type RRSPs have led to several other unsatisfactory aspects of the current bankruptcy treatment of RRSPs
?	First, only a small proportion of Canadians are aware of the exempt status of insurance-type RRSPs ? For that reason, only especially prudent self-employed individuals and non-pensioned employees, or those w/ good advisors, are able to creditor-proof their retirement funds
?	Second, those facing the possibility of bankruptcy might be tempted to convert non-exempt RRSPs into exempt insurance-type RRSPs ? However, by virtue of the Ramgotra decision, only a cumbersome fraud test is available to the trustee, under provincial fraudulent conveyance legislation, to set aside such pre-bankruptcy transactions
-	Even if the RRSP is exempt, the bankruptcy court hearing the debtor’s discharge may require that the bankrupt, in effect, draw down the RRSP by way of a conditional discharge order made in specific contemplation of the RRSP ? Not doing so, and leaving the bankrupt w/ substantial exempt assets, has been held to undermine the integrity of the bankrupt system
?	Such views are never advanced in respect of pensions, even if their capitalized value is very high, b/c pensions are inaccessible until after retirement
-	In considering reforms to the current treatment of RRSPs under the BIA, the Task Force acknowledged that it would be inappropriate if the bankruptcy system treated RRSPs in exactly the same way as pensions ? This is b/c there are several key differences that call for different treatment
1.	First, pension contributions are normally mandatory as a condition or benefit of employment, and normally include an employer’s contribution ? RRSPs are voluntary and normally fully self-funded, perhaps through borrowing
2.	Second, pension contributions are normally regular, periodic and fixed in amount ? RRSP contributions are self-determined in amount, often irregular, and are purely a matter of individual planning 
3.	Third, pensions cannot normally be accessed until retirement ? RRSPs are normally liquid so that they can be cashed or collapsed at any time, subject to a tax penalty 
4.	Fourth, RRSPs are often utilized as tax-deferred saving vehicles and are not intended exclusively, or even primarily, for retirement
-	Sound public policy ought to support and encourage prudent retirement planning ? At the same time, the BIA ought not to be available for strategic use by those who intend to shelter their assets from the reach of impending or foreseeable creditors; An overly generous exemption policy would invite abuse
-	As well, the integrity of the bankruptcy system would suffer if debtors succeeded in preserving their RRSPs through the bankruptcy process, only to be in a position to access the preserved cash shortly following, or even during, the bankruptcy ? This would flout the retirement policy goals for the exemption, and would lead to well-warranted creditor frustration

Key Recommendations
-	RRSPs should be eligible for exemption in bankruptcy on the basis of several inter-related elements 

Notes:
-	BIA s.67(1)(b.3) now expressly provides an exemption for RRSPs ? The provision confirms that property in an RRSP is not property that is divisible among the bankrupt’s creditors
?	However, the protection extended to bankrupts in s.67(1)(b.3) does not cover property contributed to such a plan in the 12 months, or any longer period that the court may specify, before the date of the bankruptcy
-	There is an interplay b/w provincial law and s.67(1)(b.3) ? Most provinces have enacted provisions creating an exemption for RRSPs and in these provinces, the RRSP will be fully exempt, including the contributions made immediately before the bankruptcy

Monteith (Trustee of) v. Monteith
Facts:
-	3 weeks after making an assignment in bankruptcy, Gail Monteith acquired her husband’s interest in the matrimonial home and household furnishings 
-	The trustee in bankruptcy claims ownership of the husband’s interest in the home and furnishings as after-acquired property that belongs to the creditors, whereas Ms. Monteith asserts that they are exempt assets to which she is entitled 

Issue:
-	Clause 67(1)(b) of the BIA states property that is exempt from execution is not divisible among a bankrupt’s creditors, but cl. 67(1)(c) states property acquired by the bankrupt prior to discharge is property that may be divided among the bankrupt’s creditors
-	The circumstances in this case brings these provisions into apparent conflict: the property in question would clearly be exempt from execution, if bankruptcy had not occurred, but a portion of it was acquired by Ms. Monteith, the bankrupt, after bankruptcy but prior to discharge
-	Does cl. 67(1)(c) take precedence over, or override, cl. 67(1)(b), or does cl. 67(1)(b) take precedence over cl. 67(1)(c)?

Held:
-	Based on our interpretation of s.67(1) of the BIA, have concluded that the assets are exempt
Analysis:
-	Re Cherniak Estate does not apply to this case 
?	Does not hold that the bankrupt is entitled to increase the amount of the exemption to the allowable maximum so as to take the value of the other owner’s interest ? It holds, instead, that the bankrupt is entitled to claim to the full amount of the exemption w/ respect to the value of his or her own one-half interest 
?	Re Cherniak Estate also stands for the authority that the nature of the interest does not affect the amount which is claimable as exempt property
-	The same must be said of the reasoning in Neve, Ranaghan & Cope Ltd.
-	Thus, neither Re Cherniak Estate nor Neve, Ranaghan & Cope Ltd. support the proposition that a bankrupt’s estate can be increased in value to encompass the trustee’s one-half interest to the maximum of the total exemption involved
-	The issue remains asto whether the trustee is entitled to a one-half interest of the exempt asset at all
-	The trustee’s principal argument rests on its interpretation of s.67 of the BIA ? The better view is that both categories of property in (c) are subject to what is cared out in clauses (a), (b) and (b.1)
?	Clause 67(1)(c) is to be construed in light of clause (b), so that regardless of when the bankrupt acquires exempt property, the exempt property does not form part of the bankrupt’s estate to be distributed to creditors ? It is the property’s status as exempt which is important and not when it was acquired
?	This interpretation is reinforced by s.68 which addresses the question of a bankrupt’s salary, wages or other remuneration ? s.68 begins by stating it operates “notwithstanding s.67(1)(b)”
?	This approach is also supported by the aims and objectives of bankruptcy law, as stated by the 1970 report by the federal gov’t ? “The principal objective of the bankruptcy system should be to rehabilitate him and give him an opportunity to make a fresh economic start in life …”
?	No case law cited to us persuades me otherwise
-	The relevance of Ramgotra to the case ta hand is this: It makes clause 67(1)(b) the dominant provision and gives primacy of place to the exempt status of a bankrupt’s property
-	We are not dealing w/ a situation where the bankrupt has acquired an increase in assets by virtue of a settlement or a fraudulent conveyance ? That body of law will continue to be influential in curb in any attempt to manipulate the distribution of assets to defeat creditors
-	In any event, if a bankrupt became entitled to a large amount of exempt property after the assignment – which would be a rare fact situation – such a result could be addressed at the application for discharge stage
-	The exemption before this Court is for property in which the bankrupt has a limited exemption ? W/ respect to limited exemption property, there is a monetary limit on what is unavailable for distribution amongst creditors w/ respect to that property 
?	In this case, the amount which is unavailable for distribution is $32,000
?	While the trustee cannot compel the sale of the property to obtain the excess above $32,000, if the bankrupt sells the property and there is excess, it will belong to the trustee 

3.4 Bankrupt’s Income and Other After-Acquired Property
Debtor’s Obligation to Contribute Surplus Income to the Estate (Pg. 561-571)
-	s.68 was completely revised in 1997, making it mandatory for the bankrupt to pay over to the trustee the surplus portion of his income as determined by policy directives issued by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy 
-	Surplus income was again an issue in the 2009 reforms ? The 2009 amendments clarify what constitutes “total income” and set out a new statutory standard of “surplus income”
-	In Re Beck the court concludes that “section 68 recognizes a reality of life, namely, even a bankrupt needs something to live on while their affairs are being controlled by their Trustee” ? However, the courts suggest that a balance must be struck b/w the investors of the bankrupt and creditors
-	“The Act holds that the bankrupt must be entitled to a fair and reasonable amount for the maintenance of himself or himself and the family ? One the one hand certain sacrifices have toe made for the benefit of the creditors”
-	At issue is how one determines the appropriate standard of surplus income such that a bankrupt is ale to maintain a reasonable standard of living
?	Under s.68(1) of the BIA, the “Superintendent shall, by directive, establish … the standards for determining surplus income”
?	According to BIA s.68(3) the “trustee shall, having regard to the applicable standards and to the personal and family situation of the bankrupt determine whether the bankrupt has surplus income”

Re Landry
Facts:
-	The respondent declared bankruptcy and the appellant was appointed trustee of the bankrupt’s estate 
-	Landry has been discharged from bankruptcy 
-	The trustee has not yet been discharged and is still attempting to realize upon the assets of the bankrupt’s estate for the benefit of the creditors
-	An arbitrator found that Landry was unjustly dismissed ? When the trustee became aware of the arbitrator’s decision, the trustee unsuccessfully attempted to intervene in the proceedings to claim the first solicitor’s costs

Analysis:
1. Does Landry’s Claim Against First Air or Any Part of the Resulting Award Constitute Property of the Bankrupt That Vests in the Trustee Under s.67 and 71(2) of the BIA?
-	S.71(2) is a general vesting section
-	“Property” is defined under s.2 of the BIA
?	“Things in action” encompass a claim for damages for breach of contract, including an action for wrongful dismissal
-	Pursuant to s.71(2), Landry’s claim against her former employer would vest in the trustee on the date she declared bankrupty and she would cease to have any capacity to deal w/ it ? However, s.71(2) is subject to the other provisions of the BIA
-	s.67 of the BIA defines what property of the bankrupt is divisible among her creditors and can serve to restrict the ambit of s.71(2)
?	It is clear that s.67(1)(c) is wide enough to encompass Landry’s claim against her former employer and, consequently, any award of damages (other than those relating to personal claims) would form part of the property divisible among her creditors under that provision
?	A Q then arises whether any part of the property falls within the exception made for exempt property under s.67(1)(b)

2. Does Any Exemption Apply Pursuant to s.67(1)(b) so as to Except Any Part of the Property from the Estate of the Bankrupt 
-	As provided under s.67(1)(b), the property of the bankrupt divisible among her creditors shall not comprise any property that as against Landry is exempt from execution or seizure under provincial law]
-	Wallace:
?	A Q arose whether Wallace could bring an action for wrongful dismissal against his former employer in his own name given the vesting provision under s.71(2) of the [then] BIA which, as s.71(2) of the present BIA, provided that a bankrupt ceases to have any capacity to deal w/ his property
?	Court said that the wording of the Act is clear and that an undischarged bankrupt has no capacity to deal w/ his or her own property, including an action for breach of contract, outside the circumstances described in s.99(1) 
?	THE court then further held that the Act made no distinction whether the property was acquired before or after the assignment in bankruptcy ? However, the court went on to consider the provisions of s.68(1) of the Bankruptcy Act as it then read and concluded that it cared out an additional exception to this general rule
-	What is of relevance to the question presently under consideration is the finding by the court that Wallace, an undischarged bankrupt, could maintain his action against his former employer for damages for wrongful dismissal not b/c of the timing of the acquisition of the property “but rather, b/c of the nature of the property in question”
-	On the authority of Wallace, the court concluded that, to the extent that the arbitrator’s award relates to the pay Landry should have received in lieu of notice, the $s would constitute “wages” for the purpose of the s.67(1)(b) exception ? However, what is also clear from Wallace is that s.67 must be considered in conjunction w/ s.68

3. Is s.67 Superseded by the Provisions of s.68 in Relation to a Bankrupt’s Wages
-	The current s.68 of the BIA differs from the former version in a # of respects
?	First, the section does not refer to “salary, wages or other remuneration” but to “total income” ? “Total income” is defined for the purpose of s.68 as including, “notwithstanding s.67(1)(b) and (b.1), all revenues of a bankrupt of whatever nature or source”
?	The section still allows the trustee to apply to the court for a determination of the amount that a bankrupt is required to pay to the estate of the bankrupt out of her total income but an elaborate procedure must be followed before such an application is made 
-	Summary of procedure:
?	First, the superintendent is directed to establish standards for determining the portion of the total income of an individual bankrupt that exceeds that which is necessary to enable the bankrupt to maintain reasonable standard of living
?	Second, the trustee, having regard to these standards and to the personal and family situation of the bankrupt, must fix the amount that the bankrupt is required to pay, inform the official receiver of his decision and take reasonable measures to ensure that the bankrupt complies w/ the requirement to pay
?	Third, where the official receiver determines that the fixed amount is not in accordance w/ the applicable standards, the official receiver must recommend an appropriate amount
?	Fourth, where the trustee and the bankrupt disagree on the amount to be paid, the trustee must send to the official receiver a request that the matter be determined by a mediation ? A creditor can also make a request for mediation
?	Fifth, the mediation takes place in accordance w/ prescribed procedures
-	In addition to this procedure, an application may be made to the court under s.68(10)
-	The reasoning in Marzetti and Wallace that led to the conclusion that s.68 was a complete code w/ respect to wages applies equally to this new section ? The current provision applies to the “total income” of the bankrupt and, as such, is even wide than the earlier reference to “salary, wages and other remuneration”; the provision expressly excludes the application of s.67(1)(b); its purpose is no different than that described in Marzetti (except that applications to the court now appear to be limited to those cases where the issue cannot be otherwise resolved); and the jurisprudential principles reviewed by the SC in Marzetti are equally important 
-	S.67 is superseded by the provisions of the current s.68 in so far as the “total income” of the bankrupt is concerned ? It follows that, as in Wallace, Landry’s claim against her former employer and any consequent award relating to lost wages do not automatically vest in the trustee under ss. 67 and 71 
?	Resort can only be had to s.68 for payment of any portion thereof to the estate of the bankrupt

5. Is the Trustee Precluded from Resorting to s.68 After the Discharge of the Bankrupt?
-	Motions judge concluded that s.68 applied to a bankrupt and not to a discharged bankrupt
?	First, the definition of “bankrupt” does not only refer to “the legal status of the person” – since Landry has been discharged, it is correct to say that she is no longer in the state of bankruptcy, but also “a person who has made an assignment” – a description that clearly applies to Landry
?	Second, although s.68 may apply more commonly to periodic wages received during the period of time b/w the assignment and the discharge, see nothing in the language of the provision that restricts its application to this time frame ? It is clear from Wallace and Marzetti that s.68 applies b/c of the nature of the property in question, regardless of the timing of the acquisition of the property or of the fact that the payment is made in a lump sum 
?	Third, do not see any policy reason why, in situations such as this case where the income is only to be received after the discharge, resort to s.68 would nonetheless have to be made before the discharge
?	Indeed, given the procedure set out under s.68, it may be impossible to resort to its provisions before payment is made or at least its quantum ascertained
?	Further, if resort to s.68 were to be limited to the pre-discharge period, the trustee or the creditors would likely oppose any discharge if any payment of income was still pending at the time the bankrupt applied for a discharge
?	Therefore concerned that such an interpretation would have the effect of unnecessarily discharges until full administration of the estate is complete ? In cases where there is pending litigation pending litigation over the payment of such income, the delay in obtaining a discharge could prove quite substantial 
?	This result would militate against the prompt rehabilitation of the bankrupt 
?	Finally, such an interpretation runs contrary to the established principle and practice that the trustee’s obligation to realize and distribute the estate of the bankrupt continues until the trustee is discharged regardless of the prior discharge of the bankrupt
-	Conclude that the trustee is not precluded from resorting to s.68 by the fact that Landry has been discharged

Notes:
-	If a debtor has surplus income it will have an impact on the time period a debtor will have to wait for his/her discharge

Ronald (Bankrupt) Re
Facts:
-	Farmer executed security agreement in favour of two secured creditors ? The security agreements contained after-acquired property clauses 
-	Both secured parties perfected their security interests
-	The farmer subsequently made in assignment in bankruptcy
-	After the bankruptcy, the Canadian Agricultural Income Stabilization Program (CAIS), a federal gov’t assistance program designed to help farmers, made a payment for $159,000 to the trustee
-	The CoA considered whether the secured creditors were entitled to the whole amount of the fund or whether s.68 of the BIA applied to allow an amount for the bankrupt to maintain a reasonable standard of living

Analysis:
-	The rights of secured creditors are dealt w/ outside the confines of the Act, except if there is specific statutory language to the contrary 
?	The 2008 Annotated Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act ? “When a debtor has made an assignment … the policy of the Act is not to interfere w/ secured creditors except insofar as may be necessary to protect the estate as to any surplus in the assets covered by the security”
?	Once the CAIS $ was in the hands of the Trustee, it was presumptively captured by the security agreements, unless some statutory or other governing provision clearly negated that result
-	S.68 is intended to assist the trustee in accessing the bankrupt’s wages for the benefit of the estate’s creditors; there is no indication in the legislation that s.68 was intended to alter the position of secured creditors vis-à-vis the bankrupt ? s.69.3(2) states that the position of secured creditors is not altered by the bankruptcy of the debtor and ss.71 and 136(1) confirm the priority granted to secured creditors by the bankruptcy regime
?	S.68 does not limit or restrict a secured creditor’s interest in a bankrupt’s assets which, by that section, are characterized as “total income”
?	The Trustee is, of course, limited and restricted by the provisions of s.68 and it must apply distributable funds in accordance w/ that section, but funds in the Trustee’s hands to which a secured creditor has a supervening right cannot fall within that category
-	The law is clear that otherwise expressly provided in the Act or another governing provision, “secured creditors may ignore the bankruptcy and deal w/ their security in the usual manner” ? This is so even though the monies in question have been realized through the efforts of the Trustee
?	The general scheme of distribution under the Act (s.136(1)) is stated to be “subject to the rights of secured creditors”
?	Moreover, while there are a few sections in the Act which provide that particular provisions apply to secured creditors, none have been identified here that could defeat the present claim of the Creditors 
-	Cannot agree with statement in Lintott v BMO ? “Section 68 is a complete code for determining what if any portion of a bankrupt’s total income will be made available for the distribution among creditors whether secured or not”
?	The right of secured creditors are not impaired by bankruptcy unless expressly so provided in legislation, and s.68 does not so provide
-	Nothing has been pointed out, in the Act or elsewhere, that could adversely affect and limit the rights of the Creditors to claim the CAIS Money under their admittedly valid and perfected security agreements
-	Absent explicit legislative provisions the interests of secured creditors prevail over those of a bankrupt trustee, even w/ respect to the income of the bankrupt 
-	Creditors prevail over the Trustee, as. S68 has no application to them ? This is not to say that payments from CAIS may not form part of the bankrupt’s “total income” for the purpose of s.68, but that question does not arise in this case, as s.68 has no application to the Creditors here
Notes:
-	If Cargill is rightly decided, bankrupts will be at the mercy of whatever provincial legislation there may be restricting or invalidating assignment of wages and other earnings
-	The provincial PPSAs have a provision outlawing after-acquired property clauses in consumer contexts

Wallace v United Grain Growers
Facts:
-	This case involves both an appeal and a cross-appeal
-	The appeal is largely concerned with issues of compensation in a wrongful dismissal action, specifically, the existence of a fixed-term contract, the right to damages for mental distress, whether or not one can sue for 'bad faith discharge', and the appropriate length of the period of reasonable notice
-	The cross-appeal raises an issue of bankruptcy law, namely, whether an undischarged bankrupt can maintain an action for wrongful dismissal in his or her own name

Analysis:
A. Capacity to Bring Action as an Undischarged Bankrupt
-	The parties agreed that the claim for mental distress, loss of reputation and punitive damages is one that is personal in nature ? Such a cause of action does not become the property of the trustee in bankruptcy and thus may be pursued by Wallace in his own right
-	However, the part of Wallace's action for wrongful dismissal that is based on lack of notice is a claim for breach of contract ? Whether or not he can maintain this claim is the issue that the parties seek to resolve in the cross-appeal
-	     Section 67(1) of the Bankruptcy Act describes the property of a bankrupt that is divisible among his or her creditors ? No distinction is made with respect to property that exists at the date of assignment into bankruptcy and property acquired after that date but prior to the date of discharge Section 67(1) reads as follows:
-	"Property" is defined in s. 2 of the Act and includes things in action which in turn include claims for breach of contract
-	     Once a receiving order has been made or an assignment into bankruptcy has been filed, s. 71(2) of the Act provides that: ...a bankrupt ceases to have any capacity to dispose of or otherwise deal with his property, which shall, subject to this Act and to the rights of secured creditors, forthwith pass to and vest in the trustee named in the receiving order or assignment...
-	     The clear wording of the statute indicates that, upon assignment into bankruptcy, the bankrupt relinquishes his ability to deal with both existing and after-acquired property, all of which vests in the trustee in bankruptcy ? As property has been defined under the Act to include things in action, it appears that an undischarged bankrupt has no capacity to maintain an action for breach of contract
-	     In this context, cannot agree with the Court of Appeal's finding that the courts have developed a common sense principle which permits an undischarged bankrupt to deal with assets acquired after the assignment in bankruptcy provided the trustee has not intervened
?	In my opinion, the ability to deal with such assets is restricted to those situations involving good faith third-party transactions for value with an undischarged bankrupt regarding the after-acquired property of the bankrupt
?	The plain meaning of the Act indicates that outside of these very narrow circumstances (or the exception created by s. 68(1), the bankrupt loses the ability to deal with his or her property regardless of whether it was acquired before or after the assignment in bankruptct
-	McNamara v. Pagecorp Inc. ? The scheme of the Bankruptcy Act is that all property of the bankrupt owned at the date of bankruptcy and which is acquired by the bankrupt prior to his discharge vests in the trustee; There is no doubt that an undischarged bankrupt cannot bring [an] action to enforce property claims and we are satisfied that such is the law even where, as here, the property is allegedly sold by the trustee to the bankrupt prior to his discharge
-	     In Long v. Brisson ? An undischarged bankrupt has no status to commence an action or other proceeding in his own name where it relates to recovery of property. That status is reserved to the trustee in bankruptcy.... This is the scheme of the Bankruptcy Act...
-	The wording of the Act is clear ? An undischarged bankrupt has no capacity to deal with his or her property and no distinction is made with respect to whether that property was acquired before or after the assignment in bankruptcy
?	In my view, the bankrupt generally will not be able to deal with his or her property outside the circumstances described in s. 99(1).
-	Nevertheless, this is not sufficient to determine that Wallace's claim is a nullity because s. 68(1) of the Act carves out an additional exception to this general rule where the property in question can be characterized as "salary, wages or other remuneration" ? Unlike the Court of Appeal, I believe an undischarged bankrupt can maintain an action against a former employer for damages in lieu of reasonable notice, not because of the timing of the acquisition of such property but rather, because of the nature of the property in question
-	     As I see the matter, the underlying nature of the damages awarded in a wrongful dismissal action is clearly akin to the "wages" referred to in s. 68(1)
?	In the absence of just cause, an employer remains free to dismiss an employee at any time provided that reasonable notice of the termination is given
?	In providing the employee with reasonable notice, the employer has two options: either to require the employee to continue working for the duration of that period or to give the employee pay in lieu of notice
?	There can be no doubt that if the employer opted to require the employee to continue working during the notice period, his or her earnings during this time would constitute wages or salary under s. 68(1) of the Act
?	The only difference between these earnings and pay in lieu of notice is that the employee receives a lump sum payment instead of having that sum spread out over the course of the notice period
?	The nature of those funds remains the same and thus s. 68(1) will also apply in these circumstances
-	In the event that an employee is wrongfully dismissed, the measure of damages for wrongful dismissal is the salary that the employee would have earned had the employee worked during the period of notice to which he or she was entitled ? The fact that this sum is awarded as damages at trial in no way alters the fundamental character of the money
?	An award of damages in a wrongful dismissal action is in reality the wages that the employer ought to have paid the employee either over the course of the period of reasonable notice or as pay in lieu of notice
?	Therefore, in accordance with the exception which is carved out in s. 68(1) for "salary, wages or other remuneration", this money is not divisible among a bankrupt's creditors and does not vest in the trustee
?	The right of action is the means of attaining these damages and is similarly exempt
-	Several courts have interpreted the phrase "salary, wages or other remuneration" broadly ? It has been held to include disability benefits, severance pay and income tax refunds 
-	Re Giroux:
?	Speaking generally, one should experience no difficulty including in the definition of salary, wages and other remuneration virtually all benefits accruing to employees
?	Unless the contract requires a restricted meaning, any reward should normally qualify, if not as "salary, wages", at least as "remuneration", whether the reward takes the form of sick pay allowance, bonuses, vacation with pay or pay in lieu of notice
-	Public policy considerations that inform s. 68(1) of the Act offer further support for interpreting the wording of that section broadly ? Marzetti:
?	...when family needs are at issue, I prefer to err on the side of caution
?	In s. 68 of the Bankruptcy Act, Parliament has indicated that, before wages become divisible among creditors, it is appropriate to have "regard to the family responsibilities and personal situation of the bankrupt"
?	This demonstrates, to my mind, an overriding concern for the support of families.
-	Until alternative employment has been obtained, the wrongly dismissed employee will require funds to support him- or herself and his or her family ? A damages award will satisfy this need, in essence, filling the pocket that would otherwise have been filled by salary or wages
?	If such an award is considered property divisible among a bankrupt's creditors that vests in the trustee, the bankrupt and his or her family may be deprived of essential income during a time of need
?	In my opinion, to remain true to the spirit of the Act, the words "salary, wages or other remuneration" in s. 68(1) must include an award of damages for wrongful dismissal
?	The same policy rationales that exempt salary, wages and other remuneration from automatically vesting in the trustee surely must operate in the wrongful dismissal context as the function of such damages is equivalent to wages or salary earned in the course of ongoing employment
?	To hold otherwise would run contrary to Parliament's intention to put the needs of families ahead of those of creditors.
-	Possibilities for abuse associated with this interpretation of s. 68(1) are few ? Creditors and trustees are still adequately protected by virtue of the fact that s. 68(1) allows trustees by their own initiative or by the direction of the creditors to go before the court for an order directing payment to the trustee of such part of the "salary, wages or other remuneration" that the court determines is not required for the support of the bankrupt or his or her family
-	I conclude that the appellant can maintain an action for wrongful dismissal in his own name ? I would therefore dismiss the cross-appeal and I now turn to the issues raised by the appeal
Re Presley
Issue:
-	Who should receive a lottery windfall won by a couple who had received conditional orders of discharge from bankruptcy

Analysis:
-	The BIA describes property in s.2
-	S.67.1(c) ? “… before discharge”
-	S.172.1 provides that, upon hearing an application for a discharge, the court may “grant an order of discharge subject to any terms or conditions w/ respect to any earnings or income that may afterwards become due to the bankrupt or w/ respect to the bankrupt’s after-acquired property”
-	In some instances a conditional order of discharge makes a specific provision that subsequent earnings or property will be the property of the bankrupt’s estate and payable to the trustee, or alternatively, will be the property of the bankrupt ? However, this type of specificity is not found in the conditional orders of discharge granted in this case, and such orders are not common in this jurisdiction
-	From the definition of property it appears that lottery winnings are property of the bankrupt and s. 67(1)(c) provides that they vest with the trustee to be available to the bankrupt’s creditors up to the date of discharge ? Therefore the question is: when is a bankrupt discharged; upon the granting of a conditional order of discharge, or only after the satisfaction of the conditions found in the order?
-	Re Sindaco ? The court noted that “there is no question...that lottery winnings are after-acquired property...[and are] divisible among the creditors”
?	In light of earlier case law dealing with a similar question in relation to other types of windfalls, this statement of the law appears well-founded
-	Re Gray ? The Court, relying on re Hawkins held that as the property vested before the bankrupt had fully satisfied the conditions of his discharge, the property vested with the trustee; In other words, a bankrupt remains in bankruptcy unless and until he fulfills the conditions of his or her discharge and his or her property is available to the creditors until the conditions are fulfilled
?	Other cases have considered and followed this decision.
-	Re Harrison ? The court noted at paragraph 6 that “the law is well settled that until a bankrupt has obtained an absolute discharge the trustee may claim any afteracquired property as an asset of the estate”
-	Kratko (Trustee of) v. Kratko Estate ? The bankrupt was given funds by a friend to pay out his conditional order of discharge; The friend had also paid, on the bankrupt’s behalf, the premium on an accidental death policy that had the bankrupt’s estate as the beneficiary; The bankrupt did not completely pay off the amount required in the conditional order before he died; His will designated the friend as both executrix and beneficiary of his estate; The friend sought payment to her of the proceeds of the insurance policy; The court held that the proceeds were the property of the trustee
-	Re Hoff ? An inheritance that arose between the date of the conditional order of discharge and the completion of the conditions was held to vest in the trustee
-	Re Speranza ? In that case the conditional order of discharge provided that the bankrupt was authorized to dispose of his after-acquired property so long as he paid the lesser of the net proceeds or the balance under the conditional order; The preamble in the order referred specifically to inherited property; Before completing the terms of the conditional order, the bankrupt inherited some shares; The trustee argued that they were after-acquired property and vested with the trustee; The Court disagreed, pointing out that the order had been drafted by the trustee and he would have to live with its termsl The bankrupt was allowed to pay out the balance of the conditional order and keep the inheritance
-	Court agreed w/ the law as sated in Re Sindaco that the lottery winnings held by the trustee are the property of the bankrupts’ estates and available to the creditors

Re Jakola
Facts:
-	Roy and Lydia are husband and wife ? Both made Assignments in Bankruptcy as a result of financial difficulties arising out of the bankruptcy of Roy’s business 
-	Inspectors were appointed for each of the estates of Roy and Lydia 

Analysis:
-	25     S.68(1) of the BIA sets out how the Superintendent sets the standards for determining the portion of the total income of an individual bankrupt that exceeds that which is necessary to enable the bankrupt to maintain a reasonable standard of living ? The Trustee is required to take into account the personal and family situation of the bankrupt and fix the amount that the amount that the bankrupt is required to pay to the estate of the bankrupt
-	There is a Directive, which sets out how the Superintendent's standards are to be applied:
?	It states in paragraph 6(1) that the bankrupt shall first complete the "income and expense statement of the family unit, including the bankrupt, in Form 65"
?	Subparagraph 6(3) how the family unit's available monthly income is determined ? Certain expenses such as child support payments and expenses associated with medical conditions are deducted first
?	In subparagraph 6(2), the Trustee is obliged to verify the accuracy of the income and expense statement and require that the bankrupt provide proof of payments ? Paragraph 7 sets out the formula whereby 50% or 75% will be applied by the Trustee; There is also Table, which sets out the number of persons in a family and the Superintendent's Standards for available monthly income for those number of persons
-	In Landry, Re, the Court sets out how Section 68 of the BIA is to be applied ? It sets out how the mediation procedure applies and states that s.68 is a complete code with respect to wages and income
-	In Demyen, Re, a decision of Registrar Herauf, the Registrar states that the guidelines set by the Superintendent are provided for the assistance of the Trustee and now have been elevated to standards "with statutory force”
-	     The Trustee must examine the total income of the bankrupt ? It includes all revenues of the bankrupt of whatever nature or source
?	Further, the Courts have held that this should be interpreted broadly 
?	It includes income tax refunds
?	Lintott v. Bank of Montreal ? Where a bankrupt was expected to travel in relation to his or her work, and was reimbursed for travel expenses paid out-of-pocket by him or her, that these are monies that are to be included in "total income"
-	It is trite law to say that Court must strike a balance between the needs of the bankrupt and the claims of his creditors
?	The Act holds that the bankrupt must be entitled to a fair and reasonable amount for the maintenance of himself or herself and the family
?	On the other hand, certain sacrifices have to be made for the benefit of the creditors
?	That is what the Directive does when the Trustee makes the calculation of surplus income
?	In my view, such expenses must be actual expenses and not estimates
-	Our Courts have recognized the importance of the veracity of the statements of income and expenses as supplied by the bankrupt to the Trustee
-	     In my view, the Trustee did exactly as she is expected to do under the Act
?	The creditors have rights in this bankruptcy, as well as the bankrupts themselves
?	In my view, the only way that surplus income can properly be determined is to examine carefully the sources of monies that come into the hands of the bankrupts each month, and to examine actual expenses
?	While I do not disagree that items such as property taxes, which are not calculated monthly, have to be averaged to get an accurate monthly amount, if it is easier for the bankrupt to make these payments monthly rather than on the due date ? The amount in question is, however, accurate, it is not an estimate.
-	The loans from the Jakolas' mothers do not have to be included as income under the Act
?	The loans, on Roy's own evidence, were applied to the family's living expenses
?	These are therefore financing the costs of current consumption but the loans are not received on a periodic basis
?	If family members wish to assist the Jakolas with certain expenses now and then, in my view it is not part of income and I hold that it is not to be included by the Trustee in Roy's income
-	Roy's Variable Compensation, if received, or any bonus received from his Employer, must be reported to the Trustee ? In Seitz, Re, it was found that a bankrupt had to report bonuses to his Trustee
-	Was provided with no law on the issue of whether Roy should be allowed to deduct his legal expenses he accrues or pays monthly ? The Court's Clerk also researched the issue and could find nothing one way or the other about it 
?	In my view, legal fees are legitimate expenses
?	If they are actually paid monthly and there is a legal bill rendered and a payment made, with cancelled cheque to prove the expense, then in my view the deduction is appropriate, but only if it relates to the bankruptcy in question
-	I note, however, that consumption includes the satellite and cell phone expenses and other non-essential expenses, which have been very large ? These are not necessities, and if the satellite is required by Roy for his work, as he claims, then his Employer should pay the cost
-	     The Jakolas are receiving a substantial income and are required under the Act to pay surplus income
Re Mostajo
Facts:
-	The relief sought by the Trustee included a declaration that all or part of a certain settlement of $ obtained by the Bankrupt as defined in s.67 of the BIA; a declaration that the transfer of such amount of the settlement as might be found to be property of the Bankrupt to Suyat and mostajo is not valid as against the Trustee pursuant to s.99 BIA; and certain other relief necessary to give effect to the foregoing, and permit the Trustee to follow the monies in question into the lands of Suyat and Mostajo as the owners of certain real property
-	Settlement was on account of the Bankrupt’s damages suffered by her in a motor vehicle accident
-	The Action was clearly outstanding at the time of this bankruptcy, yet no mention of her claim is found on her Statement of Affairs, and the Trustee deposes that no mention of the Action was made by the Bankrupt to the Trustee at any time at or subsequent to the assignment

Issue:
-	Whether or not all, some, or none of the settlement funds constituted property of the Bankrupt divisible amongst her creditors, in accordance with s. 67 BIA

Held:
-	In my view, the Trustee is entitled to a declaration that 50% of the settlement funds are property of the Bankrupt divisible amongst her creditors, and which properly devolve to the Trustee for such a division and distribution

Analysis:
-	It is important to note that any damages for pain and suffering or other personal amounts, do not devolve on the Trustee ? One of the most useful statement of the distinction between devolution of pain and suffering claims and those for loss of property is found in Re Hollister, [1926] 3 D.L.R. 707 (S.C.O.) at pp. 708-9, wherein Fisher J. says as follows:
?	The law is well settled that the [BIA] never intended to increase the assets of an insolvent for division amongst his creditors, by monies recovered in an action for personal injuries, as these monies are awarded as damages to the debtor for his pain, suffering and loss of comfort of life, to pay his physician, nurses and hospital expenses, and to compensate him whilst he is incapacitated from earning a living for himself and his family
?	It is only actions which relate directly to the bankrupt's property and can be converted into assets for the payment of creditors that pass to the debtor's trustee
?	Causes of action arising from bodily or mental suffering, such as actions for assault, seduction, criminal conversation, and damages for personal injuries, remain in the bankrupt
-	From this passage, one might be left with some confusion as to whether, exactly, damages for future loss of income or earning capacity are "to compensate him whilst he is incapacitated from earning a living for himself and his family" or "actions which relate directly to the bankrupt's property and can be converted into assets for the payment of creditors" - the former belonging to the Bankrupt, and the latter to her Trustee
-	In my view, this is answered clearly by such cases as Re Bell; Re Hogg; and Re Berridge ? The thrust of those cases is that income loss and loss of earning capacity is an asset of the Estate
?	Bell clearly finds that the loss of the ability to earn income in the future is the loss of a capital asset, which capital asset and the damages for its loss vest in the Trustee
?	This is, in my view, consistent with the BIA in that the ability of a bankrupt to earn income post bankruptcy is scrutinized by trustees and Courts in determining the proper amounts to be paid to the creditors as surplus income or on discharge
?	Surely if such an ability belongs in some measure to the creditors, then its loss must also be compensated for to the creditors
-	In the case at bar, the difficulty is in determining how much of the settlement funds relate to the loss of such an asset ? In that regard, I find the decision in re Kavanaugh; Ex Parte Bankrupt v. Jackson (Trustee) to be persuasive ? The Court held that the correct action was to divide the monies equally amongst the heads of claim
-	Despite the argument of counsel for the respondents that there are no Canadian cases following Kavanaugh, it has been referred to favourably by Deputy Registrar Stevens, of this Court, in Re Hatfield
-	I have considered also the evidence and argument that the portion of the settlement relating to loss of income might be relatively small, and less than 50% of the settlement amount ? Arguably, to apply Kavanaugh would do an injustice to the Bankrupt, and provide a windfall to the creditors
-	On the facts in this matter, including the failure of both the Bankrupt and her solicitor to advise the Trustee that the Action was being settled, I am satisfied that it is appropriate that any burden for the failure to do so properly rests with the Bankrupt ? The Bankrupt could have avoided this outcome if she had properly kept the Trustee informed
?	This is a second bankruptcy for her, and I find that she should be well aware of her obligations vis a vis the Trustee
-	In applying Kavanaugh, am not suggesting that it will serve as license for bankrupts who settle claims which are largely or entirely for loss of future income or earning capacity, to do so without notice to trustees in the belief that Kavanaugh will operate to permit them to keep some percentage on account of pain and suffering ? In my view, Kavanaugh is rebuttable, and any uncertainty or ambiguity ought to be resolved in the trustee's favour as a bankrupt always has the ability, and the obligation, to keep her trustee informed of these types of matters, and ought to fail to do so entirely at her risk
-	I find, therefore, that, as there are only two heads of relief in the Action, the application of Kavanaugh serves to conclude that one-half of the settlement funds, or $75,000.00 vested in the Trustee

February 14, 2018
Review
-	S.71 ? Vesting provision (vests the property of the bankrupt in the trustee)
-	S.2 ? What is property? Very broad definition
?	Obvious property vs. not so obvious
?	Licence ? Property
?	Mental distress ? Not property 
?	Subject to a trust even if it was bankrupt that was put into the trust but it’s no longer in the control of the bankrupt ? Not property
?	Property subjected to perfected security interest ? Not property and not under s.67
-	Provinces exclude certain property ? Purpose is for the maintenance of the debtor (Provincial exemption law) and this is not under s.67
-	Property debtor may acquire after bankruptcy and before discharge is property that falls under s. 67
-	Property does not include property that’s after acquired by bankrupt but bankrupt enters into bona fide transaction w/ third party for value before trustee goes after that property 
?	In this case, the trustee has yet to deal with it
-	Debtor can earn wages after date of bankruptcy and if those wages are earned, that property does not fall under s.67 ? s.68 tells us it’s a complete code so must be dealt w/ s. 67 and it does not fall under that section

Wages 
-	S.68 is about wages that the debtor earns after bankruptcy (surplus income section) ? Deals with how the wages are distributed
-	S.67 is about property that vests in the trustee ? The fact that wages is not part of s.67 is really important b/c what it means for the bankrupt is that wages do not automatically vest in the trustee 
?	Wages does not fall under this section 
-	S.68 does not alter the position of secured creditors
-	Re Ronald
?	S.68 is not intended to alter the position of a secured creditor 
?	Also evident in ss.69.3(2), 71, 137
?	Then have to look at the security agreement see if there’s a security interest 
-	Re Landry ? Involves post bankruptcy income 
?	What is the state of pre-bankruptcy income? Can the trustee use s.68 to access income that came in before the bankruptcy but could not be accessed until after the bankruptcy?
?	Landry’s claim was prima facie property under the BIA
?	S.71 is subject to the other provisions of the act so you have to consider s.67
?	If s.68 applies, s.67 cannot
?	SO no automatic vesting of Landry’s claim in the trustee
?	So trustee has to go to s.68 to determine what part, if any, goes to the trustee 
?	The court says s.68 is a complete code (meaning do not go under s.67 as after acquired property) & then summarized the procedure under s.68 ? Trustee has very broad powers under this section to access the wages (Para 28)
?	REMEMBER not an automatic vesting 
?	Under s.68 the superintendent has a directive ? Trustee has to look at the directive and take that into account
?	Total income does not include income tax, pensions or employment insurance
-	Surplus income directive allows a single person a monthly income of $1870; a family of four is allowed $3474
-	Calculation of surplus income are based upon a comparison of the allowable standards w/ the debtor’s available monthly income ? So does not take into consideration where the debtor resides
-	Does s.68 apply after a discharge? And what is the impact of discharge on s.68?
?	Wording of s.68 applies to a bankrupt
?	Bankrupt is the legal status of a person who has declared bankruptcy and who has not received a discharge; but bankrupt also means person who has made an assignment into bankruptcy 
?	Court has conclude that says there’s nothing in the language of s.68 that restricts its application to the pre-discharge period
-	S.68 is a separate substantial position that deals w/ income that is acquired by the debtor ? Should be interpreted broadly
-	S.68 refers to total income (surplus income is a portion of the total income) ** See the section for what’s included and what’s not
-	Re Jakola
?	Should travel expenses be submitted as income?
?	The husband didn’t get additional $$ for travel ? He was not subject to any collective agreement and he had to travel for work and had to pay for his expenses
?	He submitted the expense report and was compensated
?	Court said that if he was not living at home, he wouldn’t have incurred those expenses and these expenses do not fit under the total income in the BIA ? It’s not extra income given to him
-	Re Mostajo
?	Lost of earnings + pain and suffering = She received settlement but there was no apportionment by the bankrupt regarding the heads of damages
?	Court said trustee is entitled to 50% of the funds
?	Damages for pain and suffering is not part of estate but loss of earnings IS property of estate 
?	Issue in this case is how do you split the settlement?
?	Where it’s unclear, the correct action is to simply split in half or apportion them equally ? The bankrupt said this is injustice but Court said you didn’t keep the trustee informed and this is your second bankruptcy so you should know this already; she also had the opportunity to apportion the claim but she didn’t
?	Any uncertainty must be solved in the favour of the trustee
-	Re Presley
?	Should the excess funds from the lottery earnings be used to satisfy creditors or are they now the property of the bankrupt?
?	Have to determine when a bankrupt is discharged
?	Lottery was an after required property, meaning it’s available to the bankrupt’s creditors and a discharge is not done until the conditions have been satisfied

Trust Property
-	Excluded by s.67(1)(a)
-	Trust is an equitable obligation to hold and administer the trust for the benefit of another (the beneficiary)
-	Expressed trust, resulting trust, constructive trust, deemed (statutory trust)
?	Express trust ? Arises b/c people want to create a trust
?	Resulting trust ? Two situations where resulting trust can arise: 1) when express trust fails; 2) a person transfers $ gratuitously for another to pay something off
?	Where money is given to someone and it was never intended that that person received that as a gift ? They’re just holding it
?	Constructive trust ? Operation by law w/o any intention of the parties
?	Found if there’s some sort of unjust enrichment (Juristic reason = if there’s a contract thre would be a juristic reason)
?	Also when there’s a wrongdoing
-	These are not deemed trust and they arise by operation of law
-	HOWEVER, trusts also arise by statutes 
-	You can’t just deem a trust to arise ? It has to be at rust that arises by operation of law 
-	If something is found to be a statutory deemed trust, or if it’s found to be in trust, it doesn’t form part of the bankrupt’s estate
?	What happens if there’s a trust but there are also secured creditors?
-	The government is an unsecured creditors so that’s why they always try to create deemed trusts ? Should they be treated a secured creditor? Should they have a deemed trust? These are some of the issues that arise 
-	Certain Crown claims (very specific) are given super priority over everyone else ? Everyone else is ranked w/ everybody else

Property of the debtor and sales law
-	Only property of the debtor is going to vests in the trustee ? Includes what debtor has certain rights to
-	If creditor can show that the property that is in the possession of the debtor is not really owned by the debtor, that creditor gets that property back ? There’s a limit to this 
?	This has to be particular to certain types of property
-	What types of goods would fall under certain sales law that would allow a creditor to take their property back? ? This will be determined on the question of when does property pass? This depends on sales law (Sale of Goods Act (SGA))
-	Rules:
?	Title cannot pass before good have been ascertained
?	Where there is a contract for sale of specific goods or ascertained goods, the parties’ own intentions govern as to the time of contract 
-	If not covered by contrast, the SGA applies ? Comes in and bring sin certain provisions into the contract if the contract has not covered those provisions within them
-	Two categories of goods under the SGA: Specific and Unascertained
?	Specific Good: Goods that are identified and agreed upon at time the contract is made (Identified + Must exist at the time of contract)
?	Unascertained: These are goods that are not identified at the time the contract is made 
-	SUMMARY: Title cannot pass until the goods have been ascertained ? Why is this important? B/c the passing property depends on the type of goods
-	If not ascertained, then the buyer is simply an unsecured creditor ? Does not matter if they’ve paid already
-	Sometimes when you have a bankruptcy, certain people will step forward and say that bankrupt has my property ? Unless property actually identified in relation to a particular contract and set aside specific to that contract, the buyer is simply an unsecured creditor and do not have specific rights

3.4 Bona Fide Purchasers
-	Under s.71 of the BIA, the property of the bankrupt vests in the trustee on the occurrence of bankruptcy, and the bankrupt ceases to have any capacity to dispose of or otherwise deal w/ the property ? Therefore, as a general rule, the bankrupt cannot transfer the property to a third-party purchaser after the occurrence of the bankruptcy
?	Although the purchaser will not obtain title to the property, the third party will usually have an action against the bankrupt for breach of contract ? This claim is not provable in the bankruptcy, b/c it arises after its commencement
?	The purchaser cannot therefore participate in the distribution of assets on bankruptcy
?	B/c it is not a provable claim, it survives the discharge of the bankrupt
-	There are two major exceptions to the principle that the bankrupt lacks the capacity to transfer good title to a subsequent purchaser
?	S.75 of the BIA provides that a deed, transfer, agreement for sale, mortgage, or charge covering real property in favour of a bona fide purchaser or mortgagee for adequate valuable consideration is valid and effectual unless a bankruptcy order is registered in the land registry system in accordance w/ the laws of the province in which the property is situated
?	This protects the integrity of the land registration system, and permits third parties to rely on the register when acquiring interests in the land 
?	S.74 gives the trustee the right to register a bankruptcy order against the real property ? If this is done, a subsequent purchaser will be unable to defeat the claim of the trustee 
?	The BIA further creates an exception in respect of property that is acquired by the bankrupt after the bankruptcy and before intervention by the trustee
?	By virtue of s.67(1)(c) of the BIA, property that is acquired by the bankrupt after the commencement of bankruptcy but before discharge of the bankrupt immediately vests in the trustee and is divisible among the creditors who prove their claims in the bankruptcy
?	S.99 of the BIA provides that a dealing b/w a bankrupt and a person acting in good faith and for value and before the intervention of the trustee is valid as against the trustee in respect of after-acquired property
?	This gives the bankrupt the power to transfer a good title to a bona fide purchaser if the transaction occurs before the trustee takes possession of or control over the asset 
?	In Re Van Pelt, the court held that s.99 protects a purchaser even if the purchaser had knowledge of the bankruptcy as long as the purchaser was acting in good faith

3.5 Trusts
-	BIA s.67(1)(a) provides that the property of a bankrupt that is divisible among creditors shall not comprise property of the bankrupt held on trust for any person ? The trust is a mechanism for separating legal ownership of an asset from beneficial ownership
-	Trusts can be created in various ways:
?	By will ? Testator leaves Blackacre to T on trust for B
?	By agreement ? Where a settlor transfers Blackacre to T on trust for B
?	By declaration ? Where T, the owner of Blackacre, declares that henceforth he holds the property on trust for B
-	In all these cases, T is the legal owner of the asset but B is the real or beneficial owner ? This is the conceptual basis of s.67(1)(a)
-	In some cases, there may be room for argument about whether there is trust
-	Except for trusts arising by operation of law, there can be no valid trust unless the moving party intended to create one
?	Normally, the express use of trusts language would be sufficient evidence of an intention to create a trust, but, in Re Ontario Worldair Limited, the court held that the express trust references were undercut by other provisions of the agreement
-	Re Ontario Worldair Limited concerned the existence of an express trust
-	The express trust is not the only type of trust ? Other types include resulting trusts and constructive trusts
?	A resulting trust is a form of implied trust of the property in the transferor’s favour ? The resulting trust means that the transferee holds the property on trust back for the transferor
?	Resulting trusts have the same status in bankruptcy as express trusts
?	The Quistclose case suggests a means by which an apparently unsecured creditor might in certain circumstances obtain priority 
?	The better view is that a Quistclose trust is not a security interest for PPSA purposes and so it is not registrable
?	A constructive trust is a trust imposed by law, w/o regard to the parties’ intentions, to prevent unjust enrichment or deter wrongful conduct
-	Trusts may also be created by statute

Baltman v Melnitzer ** Constructive trust case
Facts:
-	This case, brought within the four corners of the bankruptcy of Julius Melnitzer, embraces a fight over the ownership of artwork purchased by Mr. Melnitzer in the 5 years or so before he was put into bankruptcy

Analysis:
-	W/ respect to the enrichment/corresponding deprivation elements of the required findings, the conclusion that a P has suffered a corresponding deprivation is virtually automatic once an enrichment has been found
-	Conclude, on the facts, that the Bank has made out the enrichment/deprivation elements of the unjust enrichment formula: Mr. Melnitzer received a benefit through the Bank advances and purchase of the painting and it seems that the Bank has made out a showing that it suffered a consequential deprivation
-	However the Bank’s claim must founder and fail on the shoals created by the third element of unjust enrichment cause of action – the absence of a juristic reason – as well as the remedial stage where the Bank seeks the imposition of constructive trust
-	Rathwell ? Dickson J described the third element of the formula somewhat delphically:
?	For the principle to succeed, the facts must display an enrichment, a corresponding deprivation, and the absence of any juristic reason – such as a contract or disposition of law – for the enrichment
?	Later cases have suggested that the formula must be applied flexibly and not ritualistically, depending on the facts of the given case ? In other words, rather inevitably, a case-by-case approach must be taken to the application of the formula
-	Mr. Neirinck cannot so neatly and conveniently turn aside and treat as a non-event the contract for credit b/w the parties – even though it was undoubtedly induced by Melnitzer’s ingenious and fraudulent conduct ? The plain fact of the matter is that the contract went into effect and stayed in effect for almost 2 years down to early August, 1991, when Mr. Melnitzer’s fraudulent schemes were opened to the light of day
-	All the documents and transactions in late July and on August 1 clearly show a contract relationship is alive b/w the parties, regardless of whether Mr. Melnitzer had duped the bank into granting him the credit it did
?	His conduct cannot make the contract of August 9, 1989, void ab initio and the contract provides a sound juristic reason and basis for the credit line and the advances which financed the three purchases of pictures in 1990 and 1991
-	Peter ? McLachlin J concludes that the “fundamental” question to ask under the third component of the unjust enrichment principle is this: What were the legitimate or reasonable expectations of the parties when the deal or occurrences took place? 
-	Surely, at the time of the advances in question, the Bank had no expectations whatsoever that it would or could acquire a proprietary interest in the painting which Mr. Melnitzer was purchasing ? It was content w/ its credit-line arrangements and the collateral it had received, including $1.5 million in cash which was deposited to an interest-bearing account
-	It is patently absurd to attempt to twist the unjust enrichment principle like a warm pretzel and employ it on these facts
-	For the sake of completeness, the court then dealt w/ the Q of whether, assuming they were wrong in their approach to the application of the unjust enrichment principle, this is a proper case for the imposition of a constructive trust
-	It is quite clear that, even where a cause of action for unjust enrichment has been made out, the remedy of constructive trust does not automatically issue ? The court must go on to consider the competing equitable interests to decide whether, on balance, a proprietary remedy will be imposed or whether only monetary damages will be ordered
-	On the facts of this case, do not believe it would be appropriate to award a constructive trust:
?	Relationship b/w Mr. Melnitzer and the Bank was a purely commercial and contractual relationship
?	While the Bank took certain security interests as it saw fit, none of the property at issue –the artwork – was secured by the Bank;
?	The availability to the Bank of its normal contractual remedies;
?	The availability to the Bank of its claims as a creditor in the bankruptcy;
?	The fact that the Bank is asserting a constructive trust only as a result of its own negligence, lack of investigation and breach of its own internal credit-granting rules incidental to the issuance of a credit line to Mr. Melnitzer;
?	The fact that an otherwise unsecured creditor is seeking, in effect, to “jump the queue” over other unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy
-	This is not a case, like Lac Minerals, where one party effectively stole a property from another party by taking advantage of confidential information ? Also, not a case where one party has obtained all the fruits of a property on the back of another as in Rathwell or Sorochan 
-	Rather, this is a case where a large and sophisticated commercial enterprise entered a loan contract w/ a person it was anxiously and almost desperately courting and chose to dictate the terms and conditions of the arrangement 
-	Now, having been burned by the contract, the Bank is attempting to re-write that contract and, after the fact, obtain new security at the expense of other creditors who were also victims of the same fraudster
-	Equity should not come to the aid of that single creditor at the expense of other equally victimized creditors

Notes:
-	Pettkus v Becker sets out a three-part test for unjust enrichment:
1.	Was the D enriched;
2.	Did the P suffer a corresponding deprivation; and
3.	Was thee a juristic reason for the D’s enrichment?
-	Later cases have clarified and elaborated on this test
-	In Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd, the P bank mistakenly paid $ to the D bank, which subsequently became bankrupt ? the P sued to recover the payment 
?	The case was fought on the assumption that the disputed funds remained identifiable in the D’s hands and the court declared a constructive trust over the funds in the P’s favour 
?	The result was that the P recovered payment of its claim in full ahead of the D’s other unsecured creditors 
?	The case is controversial b/c the court failed to explain why the P deserved this special treatment
?	The justification most commonly given in the academic literature is that the P was an involuntary creditor and, unlike other creditors, it did not accept the risk of the D’s insolvency
-	 In Canada, a case like Chase Manhattan might be decided by reference to the test for recovering $ paid under a mistake of fact stated in BMP Global Distribution Inc. v Bank of Nova Scotia – the payer is prima facie entitled to recovery unless: 1) the payer intended the payee to have the $; 2) the payment is made for good consideration, or 3) the payee has changed its position
?	Alternatively, the case might be decided by reference to the law of unjust enrichment as articulated in Pettkus v Becker and subsequent cases  
?	There is a division of views on which of these approaches is the correct one
?	For present purposes, however, this point does not matter b/c, whichever cause of action prevails, the court must still decide on the appropriate remedy – that is, whether to grant constructive trust relief or to limit the P to a money remedy
?	The SC has held, in the content of unjust enrichment claims, that “the first remedy to consider is always a monetary award,” and this will usually “be sufficient to remedy the unjust enrichment”
?	A proprietary remedy should only be granted if a monetary remedy would be inappropriate or insufficient
?	In principle, these limitations should apply whether the P’s cause of action lies in unjust enrichment or the law of mistaken payments as stated in BMP

3.6 Intersection of Bankruptcy and Family Law
-	When there is a breakup of an adult family relationship, one of the spouses or partners may assert a claim against the assets owned by the other
-	Bankruptcy issues come into play if one of the parties goes into bankruptcy
-	The resolution of the issue will depend on whether it is the party asserting the claim (the non-owning party) or the party who holds legal title to the assets (the owning party) who has gone bankrupt
?	In the first case, the issue is whether the right to bring an action for a share of the assets is property that vests in the trustee ? If it is, the trustee in bankruptcy will be entitled to commence or continue an action against the owing party
?	In the second case, the issue is whether the non-owning party has any kind of proprietary right in the family assets that can be asserted against the trustee ? If the non-owning party does not have any proprietary right to the assets, the non-owning party will at best have a personal claim that must be proven in the bankruptcy
?	This permits the party to share pro rata w/ the other unsecured creditors

A. Bankruptcy of Non-Owning Party
-	If the parties were married to one another, the non-owning spouse can bring an application under provincial matrimonial property legislation for a share of the assets ? This avenue is not available if the parties were not married
-	Both married and unmarried parties can assert a claim to the assets on the basis of a constructive trust imposed by the court as a remedy for unjust enrichment
-	Some courts were initially reluctant to permit a trustee in bankruptcy to pursue a non-owning party’s claim for a share of family assets
?	Alberta CoA in Tinant ? The entire purpose of the MPA is to achieve an equitable distribution of married people’s property after a marriage breakdown has occurred. It is true that the court enjoys a discretion as to how it distributes the property, but courts often enjoy discretions relating to remedy, especially where equitable principles are factors to be applied. That does not mean, however, that wherever equitable principles come into play that which is being sought or granted no longer relates to property but to an equitable order. Also the MPA makes it clear that while judges may have equitable principles into account, once they have done so, they are acquired to make an order distributing the total property belonging to the married parties
-	The trustee’s right to bring a matrimonial property application is subject to the same limitations as the applicant’s spouse’s right of action
?	A spouse is not permitted to bring a matrimonial property application unless there has been a triggering event, such as a divorce or separation 
?	If there has not been a triggering event, the spouse has merely an inchoate right that does not vest in the trustee
?	If the triggering event occurs after bankruptcy but before discharge of the bankrupt, the right of action vests in the trustee as after-acquired property pursuant to s.67(1)(c) of the BIA
-	Some commentators have argued that the occurrence of a triggering event is not enough and that the spouse must also have commenced a matrimonial property application ? Cases in Alberta have rejected this added requirement
?	Courts have similarly permitted the trustee to pursue a bankrupt’s claim to a constructive trust
?	In such cases, in contrast to matrimonial property applications, there is no requirement for a triggering event and, therefore, the trustee could conceivably bring the action even though the partners are still cohabiting

B. Bankruptcy of Owning Party
-	If the owning party goes bankrupt, the issue centers on the nature of the non-owning party’s claim
-	Under matrimonial property legislation, a court has the power to make an order for the payment of money ? In that case, the non-owning party’s claim is merely a personal one that must be proved in the bankruptcy and entitles the claimant to share pro rata w/ the other secured creditors
?	In addition to making an order for the payment of $, the court may impose a charge on the owning party’s assets to secure the payment ? In that case, the non-owning party falls within the BIA definition of “secured creditor” and obtains priority on that basis 
-	As an alternative to making an order for the payment of money, w/ or w/o a charge, the court may make an order for the transfer of property to the non-owning spouse 
?	Although jurisdictions such as Ontario and Manitoba, which use an equalization approach, confer on courts the power to make orders creating charges and transferring assets, these powers are used sparingly in situations where non-compliance w/ the order is reasonably anticipated 
?	In property-division provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, the choice of remedies is discretionary
-	Courts have held that the matrimonial property legislation in most provinces does not give the non-owning spouse any proprietary right in the family assets prior to the court making an order for the transfer of property
?	If the owning party goes into bankruptcy before such an order is made, the property vests in the trustee and the other spouse merely has a personal claim that can be proven in the bankruptcy
?	On the other hand, if the owning party goes into bankruptcy after the making of an order transferring the property to the other spouse, the assets in question are no longer the property of the owning party and so they do not vest in the trustee
-	The matrimonial property legislation in BC differs from the other provinces in that each spouse obtains an undivided half interest in the family assets on the occurrence of a triggering event ? This gives the non-owning spouse a proprietary interest in the assets as against the trustee if the triggering event occurs before the bankruptcy
-	The position outlined above is modified where exempt property is involved ? Exempt property is not divisible among the creditors in bankruptcy
?	As a result, under BIA s.69.4, the non-owning party may apply to have the stay of proceedings lifted and obtain a matrimonial property order transferring some or all of those assets to the other spouse
?	In Schreyer, the wife successfully applied to have her ex-husband’s bankruptcy discharge set aside under BIA s.187(5) on the basis that the husband misled the trustee by not disclosing the claim for an equalization of family property
-	The situation is different in respect of a claim for a declaration of constructive trust as a remedy for unjust enrichment
?	In Rawluk, the majority of the SCC held that the constructive trust arises when the duty to make restitution arises 
?	The assets will therefore be subject to the trust at the time of the bankruptcy, and will not be divisible among the creditors
?	There are, however, some serious difficulties facing a non-owning party in making this claim
?	The applicant must convince the court that a declaration of constructive trust is appropriate, given that its effect will be to prefer the applicant’s claim over the claims of other creditors

s.7 Sales
-	S.17 of the Sales of Goods Act provides that, in a contract for the sale of unascertained goods, no property in the goods is transferred to the buyer until the goods are ascertained ? This means that a person who buys goods forming part of a larger bulk cannot acquire title to the goods unless and until the goods become ascertained
-	These considerations go to the Q of legal title ? Can Buyer claim an equitable interest in the undivided harvest? The answer is tied up w/ the Q whether Buyer can claim specific performance of her contract w/ Seller
?	SGA S.50 limits specific performance to the case of specific or ascertained goods ? In the absence of a claim to specific performance, Buyer has no equitable interest in the potatoes
-	B/c Buyer has no legal or equitable interest in the potatoes, she cannot force Seller’s trustee to complete the contract ? Buyer’s only remedy is a money claim for recovery of the price and loss of bargain damages (if any)
?	Given Seller’s bankruptcy, Buyer’s money claim is likely to be worthless, or near enough to worthless 
?	The outcome might be different if Buyer held a security interest in Seller’s potato crop ? However, the facts do not indicate any security agreement b/w Seller and Buyer

 





















February 26. 2018
Provincial Fraudulent Transactions Law
-	If unable to pay debt, various things can happen especially when that person is facing bankruptcy ? Bankruptcy is not necessary for the provincial schemes
-	What happens if a person is unable to pay his/her debts in full ? May engage in preferences; at law, it simply means pay some creditors over others
-	If the debtor engages in these practices, it undermines the integrity of the bankruptcy process b/c it prejudices creditors who are part of that process
-	As a result of this, bankruptcy gives trustee to impeach these transactions
-	If the trustee is successfully able to do that, those transactions are set aside & the property that are the subject matter of these transactions goes back to the estate
-	Statute of Elizabeth ? First attempt at trying to prohibit these fraudulent conveyances
?	Some jurisdictions have adopted the Statute of Elizabeth in its entirely (Alberta, for example)
?	Others have their own fraudulent conveyances laws that has codified the Statute of Elizabeth 
-	Trustee of a bankruptcy can rely on the BIA or provincial law to challenge the validity of such conveyances
-	One of things about the statute of Elizabeth is that it applies at any time, whether the debtor is insolvent or not ? The Conveyances laws also apply anytime
-	What is a fraudulent conveyance? 
?	Statute of Elizabeth ? Conveyance made for the purpose of defeating the debtor’s creditors (Point for the debtor is that once the financial black clouds have passed, they’re going to get it back from this person) 
?	Transfer by way of gift
?	Transfers at an undervalue
?	Both of them depend on the proof of fraud BUT fraud is very hard to prove and so what you have w/ the SoE is there is a presumption of fraud that arises in different circumstances (The presumption is that the debtor intended to commit that fraud but that presumption can be rebutted)
?	Gift ? If insolvent or transaction resulted in the debtor being insolvent (Freeman v Pope)
?	An actual intention of debtor is not needed if effect of such conveyances is to defeat or hinder creditors
?	How do you rebut the presumption? ? By showing the debtor had an honest intention and it was in no way to prejudice the creditors
?	Undervalue ? Where debtor sells the asset to somebody but the value is not the fair market value
?	Here there is no presumption of the debtor’s intention
?	Proof of the other person’s collusion w/ the debtor is also needed ? This is very hard to prove
?	So what we have certain badges of fraud that have arisen: 1) Transaction was made in secret; 2) Pursuant to a deed or a contract and then the contract has self-serving words (“honestly and in good faith” “bona fide”); 3) Consideration is grossly inadequate; 4) Haste transaction; 5) Close relationship b/w parties
?	These badges of fraud now makes it open to the court to find there was a fraudulent conveyance ? The more badges you can show, the easier for the court to conclude that this was a fraudulent conveyance
?	If there is a badge of fraud, it raises the evidence of intention and the buyer’s collusion and once that intention arises, it is open to the debtor to defend themselves
?	Fraudulent conveyances legislation is somewhat difficult to figure out whether there has been a fraudulent conveyance 
-	Fraudulent Preferences Act ? Don’t need fraud
?	No fraud of the debtor but it’s a fraud against creditors 
?	Only apply if the debtor is insolvent 
?	There is a section 1 which deals w/ fraudulent conveyances 
?	So we have Statute of Elizabeth, and we have Fraudulent Preferences Act which deals with fraudulent conveyances under s.1 and then we have the BIA
?	In Alberta, we don’t have an Alberta Conveyances Act and we’re dealing with the Statute of Elizabeth
?	S.1 has an insolvency requirement
?	Under the Statute of Elizabeth, which is also provincial, there is no such requirement
-	The policy of bankruptcy is trying to make this estate for creditors for equal distribution ? Have assets of the debtor available for all the creditors at a certain time so if we’re taking assets and we’re giving them to creditors before the bankruptcy or taking property beyond the reach of certain creditors, that defeats the whole purpose of bankruptcy
-	Under the BIA, the Act allows to attack pre-bankruptcy transactions under certain circumstances ? How conveyances and preferences are dealt w/ in the BIA
-	The provincial laws operate in conjunction w/ the BIA provisions
-	Purpose of conveyance laws ? To strike down all conveyances of property made w/ the intention of defeating the debtor’s creditors except for conveyances that are made for good consideration and boni fide to persons not having notice of the fraud
?	Prevents debtor dishonesty
?	This is quite different from fraudulent preferences ? Definition of preference is to pay a creditor over another creditor and that can happen for any # of reasons
?	Conveyance, on the other hand, is when you are gifting or transferring property to keep it away from creditors
-	Common law is strongly against fraud

SUMMARY:
-	Provinces which have conveyances and preferences and the BIA
-	In the provinces, we don’t have the FCA in Alberta, but we adopt the Statute of Elizabeth
-	FPA deals with fraudulent preferences but under s.1, the Act deals w/ fraudulent conveyances ? But much more narrow in scope b/c it only deals with those who are insolvent
-	Trustee will usually attack under provincial law and under the BIA

Profile
-	Issue: Was this a settlement under the BIA or was it a fraudulent conveyance under the FCA? (Now the concept of settlement is removed from the BI and now it’s just general undervalue conveyance)
-	Held: Under the Statue of Elizabeth, yes
-	No presumption because it’s not a gift ? Freeman v Pope does not apply
-	Where does the burden fall? The person challenging the transaction but b/c this is difficult, the court recognized there are badges of fraud
?	Substantially all of debtor’s assets 
?	Timing of transfer

Optical Recording
-	Company that’s trying to cease to exist legally but one that still operates ? Becomes judgment proof b/c you can’t sue a company that has no assets and no employees
-	Issue: Was this a fraudulent conveyance; was the transaction entered into a bona fide business purpose and for good consideration?
-	The timing of this is suspect and the lack of good and valuable consideration does raise suspicion 
?	Must look at the effect of the transactions 
-	Can you have a fraudulent conveyance to a creditor? ? The issue is, is it a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent preference?
?	Traditional view is that the fraudulent conveyance involves a transfer of property to a third party that’s not a creditor ? the CoA rejected this as the provision of the fraudulent conveyances act no way limits the conveyances to third parties other than creditors
?	Was there good consideration? Was it a bona fide transaction to a person not having knowledge at the time of the conveyance? ? Found that this is a fraudulent conveyance and meets the requirements under the Act
-	This case has been criticized
-	Fraudulent conveyance statute was not enacted to deal w/ payments going to creditors and that is in fact the fraudulent preferences act

Nicholson
-	Held: Transfers are void 

FL Receivables Trust
-	Badges of fraud does not mean the court has to therefore find a proof of intent to defeat creditors
-	Para 39
?	Whether P has proved the fraudulent intent of the debtor; The P can raise an inference of fraud sufficient to put a “burden of explanation” on the D debtor 
?	The P typically raises an inference of fraud by putting forward “badges of fraud” ? These “badges of fraud” vary from case to case
?	They are no more than typical and suspicious facts that may allow the court to make a finding of fraud absent an explanation from the debtor
-	Court is not compelled to draw this inference of fraudulent intent from badges of fraud pleaded by the P ? The court may dismiss a fraudulent conveyance action b/c it has decided that the surrounding circumstances taken as a whole explain away the P’s evidence
-	Unless there’s a substantial and overriding error in how the TJ determined findings, the CoA is not going to overturn such finding
-	All of the evidence raised was not enough to determine fraud

Provincial Fraudulent Preferences Act
-	Preferences are dealt w/ under the Fraudulent Preferences Act (Assignments and Preferences Act in other provinces)
-	S.1 ? Limited to the debtor making them on the eve of insolvency (so insolvency requirement under conveyances dealt w/ s.1 under this Act)
-	BIA allows the trustee to attack preferences under certain circumstances
-	Statute is not as powerful as the fraudulent conveyances b/c there are two things: 1) Under the Alberta FPA, only a person who’s a creditor at the time of the transaction has standing; 2) there is an insolvency requirement under the FPA
-	If brought in more than one year, go to s.2 ? If you have not commenced proceedings under 1 year, you must show there was an intent (more than effect)
-	There’s a preference provision in the BIA and the BIA’s preference provision works that if you can show there was a preferential effect, it immediately gives rise to an intention ? In FPA there is no presumption that immediately arises
-	Doctrine of pressure ? If the transfer was made under pressure from a creditor, and the debtor makes a payment, then that means the debtor does not have the intent to prefer (Evidence of pressure under provincial legislation means the debtor will not have intent to prefer that creditor)
?	The DoP is quite confusing under the BIA

4. Review of Pre-Bankruptcy Transactions
4.1 Introduction
-	Trustee’s powers to claw back assets that the bankrupt may have disposed of in pre-bankruptcy transactions 
-	The BIA provisions relevant to gifts and transfers at undervalue are ss.96 and 101 ? These provisions are supplemented by the provincial fraudulent conveyance laws
-	The BIA provisions relevant in preferences are in s.95 ? These provisions are supplemented by the provincial assignments and preference laws 
-	In some cases, the provincial laws are the exclusive or predominant basis for challenging a pre-bankruptcy transactions; in other cases, there is substantial overlap b/w the BIA and the provincial provisions 
-	Where there is no overlap, s.72 of the BIA appears to envisage continued application of provincial law ? This is supported constitutionally by the provincial jurisdiction over property and civil rights 
-	In Robinson v Countrywide Factors Ltd, the SC, over a strong dissent by Laskin, upheld the constitutional validity of the provincial fraudulent preference laws ? The key passage from the judgment of Spence J reads as follows:
?	I have dealt w/ what, in my view, are the main cases upon the subject in Canada
?	Upon considering them all, as well as the decision of the Judicial Committee in AG of Ontario v AG for Canada, I have come to the conclusion that the better view is to confine the effect of what is now s.73 of the Bankruptcy Act [now s.95] to providing for the invalidity of transactions within its exact scope
?	To that extent, the Parliament of Canada, by valid legislation upon “bankruptcy” and “insolvency,” has covered the field but has refrained from completely covering the whole field of transactions avoided by provincial legislation
?	I am of the opinion that the enactment in 1949 of the provisions now found in s.50(6) [now 72(1)] of the BA is a plain indication that Parliament recognized that provisions in provincial statues dealing w/ preferential transactions were still valid provincial enactments in reference to “property” and “civil rights” and were valuable aids to trustees in bankruptcy in attacking the validity of such transactions and should be available to the said trustees in bankruptcy
-	 The practical implications of the decision is that a trustee may rely on either the BIA anti-preference provisions or the provincial laws, or both, depending on which system of law is more favourable to the trustee in the particular case

4.2 Provincial Fraudulent Conveyance Laws: Conveyances and Preferences
-	Four provinces (BC, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Ontario) have enacted fraudulent conveyances laws codifying the Statute of Elizabeth ? It is not settled whether the Statute of Elizabeth still applies in these provinces, but the Q may not matter much b/c the provincial fraudulent conveyance statutes are, in substance, the same as the Statute of Elizabeth
-	The provincial assignments and fraudulent preference laws (in all provinces except Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador, and the Northwest Territories) also contain fraudulent conveyance provisions, but these apply only if the debtor is insolvent or near insolvency at the date of the transaction ? Neither the Statute of Elizabeth nor the fraudulent conveyance laws are limited in this way
-	The Statute of Elizabeth prohibits a conveyance of property by A to B if it is made for the purpose of defeating A’s creditors ? A creditor can sue to have the conveyance set aside 
-	There are 2 main kinds of cases:
?	Where A transfers an asset to B by way of gift; and
?	Where A transfers an asset to B at an undervlaue
-	The so-called rule in Freeman v Pope says that, in case (1), the courts will presume A’s intention to defeat creditors if A was insolvent at the date of the transaction or the transaction caused A to become insolvent ? The rule in Freeman v Pope is a substantial evidentiary concession in favour of a creditor who is attempting to have the transaction set aside 
-	There is no corresponding concession for case (2) ? IN case (2), the courts require actual proof of A’s intention to defeat creditors
?	They also read the statute as requiring proof of B’s collusion in A’s illegal purpose; if the transaction displays one or more of the badges of fraud (e.g. if it is carried out in secret, if A and B are related to one another, or if there is litigation pending against A) this will be enough to establish A’s illegal purpose unless A provides an innocent explanation
-	The policy behind the provincial fraudulent conveyance laws is the prevention of debtor dishonesty ? The laws are not specifically bankruptcy laws
-	Neither the Statue of Elizabeth nor the provincial fraudulent conveyance statutes are limited to eve-of-bankruptcy transactions ? Theft is theft whether it occurs inside or outside bankruptcy
-	Outside bankruptcy, the provincial fraudulent conveyance laws give judgment creditors a weapon to attack fraudulent transfers
-	Inside bankruptcy, the weapon passes to A’s trustee to exercise on behalf of all unsecured creditors
-	The corresponding provision in BIA s.96 applies only inside bankruptcy, but this is not b/c the policy is different ? It is simply b/c the BIA is a bankruptcy statute; if A makes a gift to B when A is insolvent or near insolvency, the transfer is voidable under the Statute of Elizabeth and the provincial fraudulent conveyance laws 
-	It is important to be clear about the reason why ? The reason is not that bankruptcy policy dictates this outcome; it is that, in the circumstances, the courts presume A’s intention to defeat creditors; in other words, the policy is still to prevent dishonesty

Profile United Industries Ltd v Coopers & Lybrand
Issues:
-	Whether a payment made by one related company to another was a “settlement” within the meaning of s.69 of the Bankruptcy Act [now BIA s.91]
-	Whether the payment was made in contravention of the Statute of Elizabeth

Analysis:
-	The Statute of Elizabeth makes a distinction b/w voluntary conveyances and bona fide transfers for consideration ? s.6 of the statute provides that the statute does not extend to any conveyance made upon good consideration and “bona fide lawfully conveyed” to any person not having notice or knowledge of the fraud or collusion against the creditors 
-	The applicable rule is stated in 17 Hals as follows:
?	For creditors to be in a position to impeach an alienation of property by their debtor they must prove, in addition to fraudulent intent on the part of the grantor, either that the alienation was not made for valuable consideration or upon good consideration, or that the grantee was privy to the fraud
?	Otherwise the grantee will be entitled to the protection given by the provision, even where a creditor is in fact defeated by the grant 
-	BMO v Vandine et al:
?	Two questions have to be addressed under the Statute of Elizabeth – (1) Whether the conveyance in question was made by the debtor w/ intent to “delay, hinder or defraud” his creditors; and (2) if there was such intent, whether the party buying such property participated in such fraudulent intent
-	When a transaction is entered into for good and valuable consideration the burden of proving that it was made in fraud of creditors is upon those who seek to set the transaction aside
-	Although it is recognized that there can be no hard and fast rule as to what constitutes a fraudulent transaction, since the decision in Twyne’s Case, the existence of certain unexplained circumstances have sometimes been looked upon as “badges of fraud” so as to take the case out of the protection afforded to a bona fide purchaser ? Two of the categories mentioned that have some relevance to the present case are the generality of the transfer, i.e,, the inclusion therein of substantially all of the debtor’s property, and the transfer of assets pendent lite
-	But overall what must be determined in each case as a question of fact is whether a concurrent intent on the part of the parties to defraud a creditor has been established by a preponderance of evidence
-	In the instant case it was established that Fisheries sold its only substantial revenue producing asset and diverted the net sale proceeds to Profile in an effort to avoid payment to Excel which had sued it
-	While it is true that Profile undertook to collect Fisheries’ receivables and to pay its outstanding accounts it is also true that Profile, Fisheries and Freezers were associated companies, all controlled by Mr. Robichaud 
-	And as the TJ took pains to point out, although he was present at the trial, Mr. Robichaud did not testify
-	In all of the circumstances, the TJ categorized the diversion of Fisheries’ fund to Profile as an unusual business transaction and one which prevented Fisheries from paying its debts in a fair and equitable manner at a time when it was insolvent
-	More importantly, he also found that Profile shared Fisheries’ desire to exclude Excel from the payment of debts
-	The TJ therefore concluded that the trustee was entitled to succeed on the basis of the Statute of Elizabeth b/c as a result of the impugned transaction there were no funds left for Excel “as Profile chose to pay other creditors instead” ? Agreed by CoA

Optical Recording Laboratories v Digital Recording Corp
Facts:
-	On the petition of the respondent creditor, Granger J adjudged the appellant debtor bankrupt and issued a receiving order against it finding that the appellant had committed acts of bankruptcy contrary to ss.42(1)(b) and 42(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act
-	The appellant appeals from the receiving order, contending that the TJ erred in finding the particular acts of bankruptcy 
-	The respondent cross-appeals, contending that the TJ erred in failing to go further and finding that the appellant had committed, in addition, an act of bankruptcy under s.42(1)(c) of the Act by creating a fraudulent preference

Analysis:
Whether the “Conveyances” Constitute Fraudulent Conveyances in Law
-	Although the Bankruptcy Act is the governing federal legislation, it has long been recognized that creditors are entitled to make use of the rights and remedies provided under provincial legislation to the extent that such legislation is not in conflict w/ the Bankruptcy Act
-	There is no definition of “fraudulent conveyance” in the Bankruptcy Act 
?	Under the Fraudulent Conveyances Act (Ontario), a debtor makes a “fraudulent conveyance” if he makes a “conveyance” of property “w/ intent to defeat, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or others of their just and lawful actions”
?	By s.1(a), the term “conveyance” includes a “charge” on the debtor’s property
-	The provisions of the Fraudulent Conveyances Act defining a fraudulent conveyance in no way limit such transaction to conveyances to third parties other than creditors ? There is no rational reason to read into the legislative definition such a restrictive interpretation
-	The legislation, being remedial, should be given a liberal construction
-	Creditor-Debtor Law in Canada ? States the purpose of fraudulent conveyance legislation as follows:
?	The purpose of the Statutes of Elizabeth and of the Canadian Acts based on it, as interpreted by the courts, is to strike down all conveyances of property made w/ the intention of delaying, hindering or defrauding creditors and others except for conveyance made for good consideration and bona fide to persons not having notice of such fraud
?	The legislation is couched in very general terms and should be interpreted liberally
?	Lord Mansfield concluded that the common law had always been strongly against fraud in every shape and that the Statute of Elizabeth “cannot receive too liberal a construction, or be too much extended in suppression of fraud”
?	Relying on the policy, the courts have interpreted the statute to include any kind of alienation of property made w/ the requisite intent, the form of the transaction being immaterial
?	Similarly the legislation has been held to invalidate a conveyance of any kind of exigible or attachable property of the debtor, so long as it is of some real value 
-	In determining whether a conveyance is fraudulent under s.42(1)(b) or (c) of the Bankruptcy Act, it is irrelevant whether the transfer was made to a creditor ? Instead, what is germane to such an inquiry is the genuineness of the conveyance 
?	To this end, s.3 of the Fraudulent Conveyances Act precludes the impeachment of a conveyance “upon good consideration and bona fide to a person not having at the time of the conveyance to him notice or knowledge of the intent set forth” in s.2 

The Cross-Appeal
-	The TJ erred in failing to make a finding of insolvency within the meaning of the definition in s.2 “insolvent person” (c) ? At the material time of the petition, the financial statements filed in the proceedings clearly established that the liabilities of Laboratories far exceeded its assets
-	It must not be overlooked, as well, that the TJ earlier found that Laboratories was a “creditor” of Digital and this finding could only be supported on the basis that money was owing to Digital under the promissory note
-	Would allow cross-appeal and vary the judgment below to include a finding that the appellant committed an act of bankruptcy as well, contrary to s.42(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act by making a conveyance of its property and creating a charge thereon that would, under the Bankruptcy Act, b void as a fraudulent preference

Nicholson v Milne
Facts:
-	Trial to determine whether, inter alia, certain transfers of assets void under either or both of Statute of Elizabeth or Fraudulent Preferences Act

Analysis:
-	The Statute of Fraudulent Conveyances recites that the purpose of the legislation is to avoid “all and every feoffment, gift, grant, alienation, bargain and conveyance” of “lands” and “tenements” and of “goods and chattels” which are “devised and contrived of malice, fraud, covin, collusion or guile, to the end, purpose and intent, to delay, hinder or defraud creditors” ? The statute declares all such transactions “to be clearly and utterly void, frustrate and of none effect”
-	The applicable provision of the Fraudulent Preference Act is s.1:
?	Subject to sections 6 to 9, every gift, conveyance, assignment, transfer, delivery over or payment of goods, chattels or effects or of bills, bonds, notes or securities or of shares, dividends, premiums or bonus in any bank, company or corporation, or of any other property, real or personal, made
?	(a) by a person at a time when he is in insolvent circumstances or is unable to pay his debts in full or knows that he is on the eve of insolvency, and
?	(b) w/ intent to defraud, hinder, delay or prejudice his creditors or any one of more of them,
?	is void as against any creditor or creditors injured, delayed or prejudiced
-	The principal difference b/w the two statutes, in their application to this case, is that s.1(a) of the Fraudulent Preference Act requires that the gift or conveyance be by a person who is insolvent, unable to pay his debts in full or who knows that he is on the eve of bankruptcy ? That is not a requirement of the Statute of Elizabeth
-	It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the only assets Mr. Milne had from which Mr. Nicholson’s judgment could have been satisfied were the Sylvan Lake property and the RRSP ? The one he transferred to his daughters as a gift, and the other he rendered exempt from execution and seizure by naming his daughters as beneficiary
-	Mr. Milne's testimony that he transferred the property to his daughters to simplify his estate does not stand up in light of the fact that by transferring the property when he did he incurred a very substantial capital gains tax ? Had he waited until the following year, he could (to his knowledge) have received the benefit of the $100,000 capital gains exemption
?	All of these circumstances, coupled with the timing of the events, satisfy me that Mr. Milne transferred the Sylvan Lake property with the intent to defeat or delay his creditors, and in particular Mr. Nicholson
-	Given the fact that Mr. Milne is a solicitor who specializes in estate matters, it is hardly credible that his interest in tidying up his estate to save probate fees lay dormant for a period of over five years but became important just at the time when the transfer of the beneficial interest in the R.R.S.P. would result in it being exempt from execution under Mr. Nicholson's writ
-	I am satisfied that Mr. Milne transferred the Sylvan Lake property to his daughters and changed the beneficiary on his Sun Life policy from his estate to his daughters with the intent to delay or hinder his creditors and, in particular, Mr. Nicholson
-	In the case of Arthur Davis, his financial position was and is much the same as Mr. Milne's and I am satisfied that his two R.R.S.P. policies represent the only real assets available to satisfy Mr. Nicholson's writ
?	Like Mr. Milne, Mr. Davis also withdrew amounts from his RRSP’s when the Q of the exigibility of those vey assets was before the court
?	The coincidence of all these events and the financial condition of Mr. Davis satisfy me that the change in beneficiary on the one R.R.S.P. and the transfer of the other into an insurance policy with a designated beneficiary, with the result, in both cases, that the assets were rendered exempt from execution and seizure, were accomplished with the intent to defeat or delay Mr. Davis' creditors and in particular, Mr. Nicholson
-	Having found that the impugned transactions were, in each case, made w/ the intent to delay or hinder creditors, what legal consequences flow?
?	I do not consider it necessary to make a determination as to whether the debtors Mr. Milne and Mr. Davis were, at the time of the transactions, insolvent, because I propose to deal with this matter under the provisions of the Statute of Elizabeth, rather than under the Fraudulent Preferences Act of Alberta
-	As I have found that the transfer of the Sylvan Lake property to Mr. Milne's daughters was made without consideration and was a conveyance of property made with the intent to hinder or delay his creditors, that transfer is void, and of no effect
-	The question remains as to whether the transactions involving the R.R.S.P. policies can be set aside under the Statute of Elizabeth ? Do the transfer of an annuity from a mutual fund into an insurance policy with a designated beneficiary and the change in the designation of a beneficiary from the debtors' estate to a designated beneficiary (both of which have the effect of rendering the asset exempt from execution or seizure, and both of which I have found were accomplished with the intent to defeat or delay creditors) constitute dispositions of property which are subject to the Statute of Elizabeth?
-	The question has been touched upon in Re Geraci:
?	The Ontario Court of Appeal held that the designation was void against the trustee in bankruptcy as a settlement within the meaning of s. 60(1) of the Bankruptcy Act ? In delivering the judgment of the court, Jessup J.A. went beyond the issue as to whether a designation constitutes a settlement under the Bankruptcy Act and stated:
?	I agree with the learned trial Judge that the declaration made by the bankrupt, changing the beneficiary of his policy of insurance to his wife while he was insolvent, was a fraudulent conveyance within the meaning of s. 2 of the Fraudulent Conveyances Act and, if it was necessary to do so, I would hold that it was therefore fraudulent and void against his creditors and that such a void designation does not attract the protection against creditors provided by either s. 162 or s. 157 of the present Insurance Act.
?	(Sections 162 and 157 are similar to ss. 265 and 260 of the Insurance Act of Alberta)
-	A more recent decision of the Alberta CoA sheds further light on the problem, although again dealing w/ a situation under the Bankruptcy Act ? Wilson v Doane Raymon Ltd:
?	The respondents sold non-exempt assets and used the funds to purchase an exempt asset, and within a year of the purchase made an assignment in bankruptcy
?	Haddad J.A. held the conversion from a non-exempt asset into an exempt asset to be a determining factor in the appeal
?	The court held the purchase of the non-exempt asset to be a "settlement" which the learned justice of appeal described as follows: "A settlement within the scheme of the statute occurs when a disposition of property reduces the bankrupt estate available to the trustee for distribution to creditors", and observed that in the case before the court "the effect of the transactions in which they engaged was to make smaller the estate which evolved upon the trustee for the benefit of creditors"
-	That case deals with the interpretation of the meaning of settlement for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act ? But settlement is not a term defined in the statute, it is a general term of common law
?	Although the Ontario and Alberta Courts of Appeal do not deal directly with a disposition under the Statute of Elizabeth, they are helpful in determining the general attitude that should be adopted in interpreting fraudulent preference statutes
?	Those cases demonstrate an intention to interpret the language in such a way as to protect against debtors taking unfair advantage of their creditors
?	The same purpose-driven interpretation should be applied to fraudulent preference statutes including the Statute of Elizabeth
-	I find additional assistance in Dunlop, Creditor-Debtor Law in Canada, Carswell (1981), where the author in dealing with the policy of fraudulent conveyance statutes, states:
?	The purpose of the Statute of Elizabeth and of the Canadian Acts based on it, as interpreted by the courts, is to strike down all conveyances of property made with the intention of delaying, hindering or defrauding creditors and others except for conveyances made for good consideration and bona fide to persons not having notice of such fraud
?	The legislation is couched in very general terms and should be interpreted liberally
?	Lord Mansfield concluded that the common law had always been strongly against fraud in every shape and that the Statute of Elizabeth "cannot receive too liberal a construction, or be too much extended in suppression of fraud"
?	Relying on this policy, the courts have interpreted the statute to include any kind of alienation of property made with the requisite intent, the form of the transaction being immaterial
?	Similarly the legislation has been held to invalidate a conveyance of any kind of exigible or attachable property of the debtor, so long as it is of some real value
-	Quite a different approach is taken by Gibb J. in Sovereign Gen. Ins. Co. v. Dale where the debtor purchased an insured annuity from a life insurance company using the proceeds of his self-directed R.R.S.P. and designating his wife as beneficiary
?	Under s. 147 of the Insurance Act, the annuity was exempt from seizure
?	The plaintiff sought to set aside the transaction as a fraudulent preference
?	Mr. Justice Gibb found an intent on the debtor's part to delay or hinder the plaintiff from realizing on his judgment, but held that there was no disposition of property within the meaning of the Act
?	He held that the designation of the defendant's wife was not a disposition because, until the interest vested, the expectation of the beneficiary was based on a contingency
?	The British Columbia legislation covers only "a disposition of property", whereas the Statute of Elizabeth refers to "every feoffment, gift, grant, alienation, bargain and conveyance of lands, tenements, hereditaments, goods and chattels, or any of them" ? This is language which is obviously intended to be broad and all encompassing
-	The term "Conveyance" (like the term transfer) is itself wide enough to encompass every method of disposing of, or parting with, property or an interest therein, absolutely or conditionally ? The word is of general meaning and, given a liberal interpretation, includes the transactions here which resulted in the transfer of entitlement to the benefits of the R.R.S.P. property from the debtor to another in such a way as to remove it from execution by creditors
?	In my view, such a transaction comes within the meaning of "conveyance", as that term is used in the Statute of Elizabeth
-	Do not think this interpretation is at variance with the view expressed by Stevenson J.A. in Sembaliuk v. Sembaliuk where he defines the term "conveyance" in the Statute of Elizabeth to mean that "the debtor has made over property” ? To "make over property" or to "convey property" has, I believe, the same meaning as to "transfer property"
?	It is on the basis of the meaning of "transfer of property" that I have reached my conclusion that the transfer of the right to receive the benefits of the R.R.S.P. property, even if it is subject to being divested, is a conveyance of property which comes within the Statute of Elizabeth if made with the intent to delay or hinder creditors
-	Accordingly, I prefer to follow what I perceive to be the principles set out in Re Geraci and Wilson and to give the legislation a liberal interpretation with the result that I conclude that the transactions involving all of the R.R.S.P.'s fall within the Statute of Elizabeth and are void
Christensen v Christensen Estate
Facts:
-	This case requires this Court to decide what is the scope of exemption from exigibility for annuities
-	The appellant trustee in bankruptcy discovered that the annuity pays more each month than the bank loan payment, and the bank was releasing the surplus to Mrs. Christensen ? He accepted the validity of the security held by the bank for its monthly payment, but claimed the balance as an asset available for creditors
-	A dispute then arose between the trustee and the annuitant whether all or any of the proceeds of the annuity are available to the trustee for distribution to creditors
-	They are not available if they, by provincial law, are exempt from seizure by those creditors
-	It is common ground that, if the proceeds are not exigible, it would only be by operation of s. 240.1 and s. 265 of the Insurance Act. Bank of 
-	The dispute then turns on the interpretation of s. 265
-	Section 240.1 provides:
?	240.1 For the purposes of this Part, an undertaking entered into by an insurer to provide an annuity, or what would be an annuity except that the periodic payments may be unequal in amount, shall be deemed to be and always to have been life insurance whether the annuity is for
?	a term certain,
?	a term dependent either solely or partly on a human life, or
?	a term dependent solely or partly on the happening of an event not
?	related to a human life.
-	Section 265 provides:
?	265(1) When a beneficiary is designated, the insurance money, from the time of the happening of the event on which the insurance money becomes payable, is not part of the estate of the insured and is not subject to the claims of the creditors of the insured
?	(2) While a designation in favour of a spouse, child, grandchild or parent of a person whose life is insured, or any of them, is in effect, the insurance money and the rights and interests of the insured therein and in the contract are exempt from writ proceedings
-	It is common ground that the proceeds of the annuity here are deemed to be insurance money ? It is also common ground that any portion of the annuity payments that go to Mrs. Christensen as a named beneficiary are not available to the trustee pursuant to s. 265(2)
-	The dispute is over the future claims of the respondent annuitant, claims that realize, after the expiration of the 180 months or upon Mrs. Christensen’s death ? In other words, she is a named beneficiary within the scope of s. 265(2) and, at least while she receives the proceeds, they are by that section exempt from seizure by his creditors and therefore his trustee in bankruptcy

Issues:
-	Two issues are raised by the appellant trustee:
?	The first is whether, because the annuitant is the alternate beneficiary during the first 15 years, the trustee can claim any payments that may fall due to him during that period in the event of the death of his wife
?	The second is whether the section exempts proceeds never assigned to the wife, i.e. any proceeds that may come to the annuitant after expiration of the 15-year period, assuming he survives ? If it does not, all payments after expiration of the 180 months would be exigible
?	A third issue was raised by the respondent annuitant, and assumes success by the trustee on either one of the first two grounds ? In either event, it was argued, a receivership order creating a bankruptcy does not attach future contingent interests, and the right of the annuitant personally to future proceeds after expiration of 180 months or upon the death of his wife fell into that category

Held:
-	The learned trial judge was correct to find that the entire proceeds were exempt ? Because of the view I take on the first two issues, it will not be necessary to deal with the third

Analysis:
I.
-	The first argument for the trustee is that only the proceeds for 180 months were assigned to the wife ? Any other interests of the annuitant in the contract, it was said, were not assigned and are exigible
?	These other interests include the annuitant’s right to be the replacement beneficiary in the event of the early death of the beneficiary
-	This argument is almost but not quite moot
-	By my calculation, Mrs. Christensen need survive only until the first week of January, 1997, to receive all of her share
-	The trustee must of course face the argument that, at least as long as the designation exists, s. 265(2) expressly protects the “rights and interests of the insured”
?	In the case of an annuity, the insured is the annuitant
?	In other words, so long as the designation is in place, both the beneficiary and the annuitant can claim an exemption
-	The reply for the trustee is that this protection is co-terminus with the designation of the wife as beneficiary, and that designation, in the words of s. 265(2), is not “in effect” the moment she dies
-	This response implies that the sole purpose of the extension of exemption to the annuitant (or the insured) is to protect the interests of the beneficiary
-	It is quite correct that, in the case of “ordinary” life insurance, by which I mean life insurance with a cash surrender value, the benefit of an exemption for the beneficiary would be lost if the creditors of the insured could attach and invoke the right to surrender
?	Thus, effective protection of the beneficiary’s interest probably requires some sort of exemption for the insured
?	And, if the sole office of s. 265 is to protect beneficiaries, the trustee should succeed in this argument
-	This argument assumes, of course, that there is no reason why the Legislature may wish to protect the interests of the annuitant for his own sake
-	In my view, then, this argument stands or falls on a decision about the scope of s. 265(1) as much as one about s. 265(2), and that issue is also engaged by the second argument for the trustee
-	This is that, upon the expiry of the 180 months, the wife will cease to be a designated beneficiary, and s. 265(2) no longer will apply
-	This is an argument for attachment of the funds due beginning in January, 1997, but not an argument for attachment of funds before that day
-	But that argument also must face the issue about the scope of s. 265(1)
-	In the end, these two arguments for the trustee blend, and the determining issue in the case is the scope of s. 265(1)

II
-	Section 265(1) provides that,”… when a beneficiary is designated…” the insurance money is “… not subject to the claims of the creditors of the insured …” ? The term clearly requires the appointment of a beneficiary as a trigger to its application
-	But does the section then cease to operate if the designation ceases? That is not so clear
-	For the trustee, it is said that the designation is a continuing condition, and that s. 265(1), like s. 265(2), ceases to have any effect once the designation ends. When Mrs. Christensen ceases to be the designated beneficiary, either by death or by expiration of time, the section ceases to apply
-	For the annuitant, it is said that the need for a designation is a true condition precedent ? Once met, the condition no longer applies; So long as a beneficiary is once designated, the proceeds of the policy are forever afterward put beyond the reach of creditors
-	Counsel were not wrong to make arguments turning on purpose ? Professor Sullivan, in Driedger on the Construction of Statutes re-stated, after a careful and exhaustive review of the authorities, the modern rule of interpretation:
?	… courts are obliged to determine the meaning of legislation in its total context, having regard to the purpose of the legislation, the consequences of proposed interpretations, the presumptions and special rules of interpretation, as well as admissible external aids
-	In other words, the courts must consider and take into account all relevant and admissible indicators of legislative meaning ? After taking these into account, the court must then adopt an interpretation that is appropriate
?	An appropriate interpretation is one that can be justified in terms of (a) its plausibility, that is, its compliance with the legislative text; (b) its efficacy, that is, its promotion of the legislative purpose; and (c) its acceptability, that is, the outcome is reasonable and just
-	In my view, either interpretation here is plausible
-	In reliance on the evidence available to me about legislative policy, which I shall now review, I am inclined to favour the interpretation offered by the annuitant ? I have also tested that view for its reasonableness; That has led me to some misgivings that I shall also express

III
-	In my view, the key to this case is to ask oneself why the Legislature would lift any insurance or annuity proceeds, whether in the hands of beneficiary or annuitant, above the reach of creditors
?	The answer lies in the social fact that, for at least a century, life insurance, and more recently an annuity or other investment contract, has been a very popular form of retirement savings
?	Life insurance is a way the breadwinner saved to provide retirement income for his family as well as relief for them in the event of sudden death
?	It soon became the policy of government to encourage that practice, perhaps because otherwise the dependent would make a call on the public purse
?	To put these assets beyond creditors was an easy step for government to encourage this wholesome practice, and also protect itself 
-	Over the past century, amendments have been made to extend the protection to these other situations
-	And, if encouragement of savings for the old age of one’s dependents is sound public policy, it is equally sound to encourage savings for one’s own advanced years
-	Unsurprisingly, then, Legislatures have more recently amended the laws in question to cover annuities ? And it is consistent to extend that exemption to the annuitant
-	As noted by Riesenfeld (1956-57) 598-599, early legislative policy was, … based primarily on the solicitude of the law not to interfere with provisions, however tenuous, for family members or other persons close to the insured after the latter’s death ? However, in the court of time a supplementary exemption policy has taken hold, which accords immunity from debts in order to enable the insured to provide for his own later years
-	The final step in such a policy may be to protect unmatured savings schemes from the attack of creditors, and there are some signs of this in some provinces
-	In this wider context, it should not be surprising that Alberta in 1981 amended the Act to deem annuities to be insurance policies (always clumsy legislative shorthand) and thus extend s. 265 to them ? And it does not surprise me that the Ministerial Statement that accompanied introduction reflected the tradition I have identified:
?	… We’ve always understood that we could provide for the future for ourselves, our spouses, our children, and know that regardless of what hard times might lie ahead, whatever we put aside in that fashion would not be subject to the claims of creditors, unless what was done was a fraudulent preference
?	Assuming that one purchased an annuity, a policy of insurance, in good faith for this purpose, one would rest with the assurance that that policy, that annuity, was available to provide for the event one wanted to ensure against or provide for the annuity payment that one wanted to provide for himself, his spouse or his family
?	… the proposed amendment to the Insurance Act would make it abundantly clear that for the purposes of the Act, life annuities are in fact life insurance and are entitled to all the protections afforded by the Act to those who purchase those annuities
?	In doing so, we recognize that other provinces have also wanted to do exactly that, to protect those persons who had dealt in good faith in the purchase of those annuities
-	I do not cite the Ontario Law Reform Commission or the Ministerial Statement as aids to interpretation in the narrow sense ? I cite them rather because they both illustrate the social customs I claim underlie and drive s. 265, and they are thus evidence in support of my claim about the existence of those facts
?	The Ministerial statement, furthermore, may evidence a general and reasonable expectation about the scope of these terms, one upon which people may have relied to order their affairs.
-	In sum, I agree with Marshall J.A. in M.N.R. v. Anthony:
?	It appears axiomatic that the fostering and nurturing of pension plans, and the encouragement of persons to make provision for their retirement during their productive working years, can be regarded as a desirable objective in today’s society
?	The insurance annuity is one of the vehicles for the self-employed to make such provision for themselves, and their families on retirement
?	To encourage the accumulation of savings for pension-type provision on retirement, and for the protection of the security of people in their advancing years, the laws have seen fit to place these funds beyond the reach of creditors
-	Granted this wider context, it seems that one should accept the interpretation of s. 265(1) that would have the effect of extending its benefits both to annuitants and the beneficiaries of annuitants

IV
-	Is it a reasonable and just conclusion to say that the need for a designated beneficiary is not a continuing condition to the exemption granted by s. 265(1)?
-	The redoubtable Taylor, J. (as he then was) in Bank of Montreal v. Freedman expressed concern about the possibility of abuse by a person who puts aside substantial assets for no reason other than to evade obligations to his creditors 
-	Early exemption legislation guarded against this by an express requirement that there be no fraudulent preference ? In other words, a provision that the exemption is lost if the creditor can show that the sole purpose of the policy was to evade obligations
?	I assume that sort of remedy is sometimes available in Alberta because of the general rules about preferences
-	It seems to me that the statute assumes too much, because it assumes that every annuity is for the purpose of retirement living ? I would have thought the Legislature would want to canvas the possibility of abuse, and consider some sort of limit for the protection of creditors
-	But I cannot agree with Taylor, J. that the risk of abuse is a reason why I should not put the broader view on the scope of s. 265(1)
?	The legislative history here reflects hesitant and imprecise expansion of the right to an exemption by the elimination of anomalies as they come to be seen for what they are ? That process is not over
?	Similarly, it is said for the annuitant that the condition requiring the creation of a designated beneficiary is unreasonable ? Indeed, if the purpose of the statute is to offer protection to savers, why limit that help to savers who happen to have beneficiaries in the named class? Why should unmarried persons without dependents not have the same protection?
?	Counsel for the annuitant indeed argued that such a rule offends Charter equality values ? No Charter relief as such was sought, but we were invited to invoke Charter equality values as an interpretive aid
?	But the only aid I could offer those who may be adversely affected by the beneficiary rule would be to strike it down, which rather sounds to me like more than just “interpretation”
?	Indeed, the argument here comes powerfully close to one against the interests of the annuitant ? One could argue thus: if the purpose of the rule is to protect both annuitant and beneficiary, there is no need for any condition about the designation of a beneficiary
?	But there is such a need clearly expressed in the statute
?	Therefore, it cannot be that the statute was designed to protect anybody other than a beneficiary
-	In my view, the limitation of the membership in the class to “approved” beneficiaries may offend Charter values about equality, if no more than the aspect of equality that condemns capricious exceptions to general rules 
?	And perhaps it must be read up or struck down if that sort of relief is properly sought
?	But that is not this case, both factually and procedurally ? It is common ground that Mrs. Christensen is in the class of approved beneficiaries
-	And perhaps the need for any designated beneficiary also offends the Charter sense of equality for those who have no dependents but who nevertheless want to save for their old age ? That is something I urge the Legislature to address; But I reject this as a reason to offer a narrow interpretation of the statute
-	Yet another exists ? In Alberta, s. 265(1) continues to apply only when the policy has not yet matured
?	That has no bearing on this case, because this annuity matured almost immediately
?	But the latest trend is to extend the protection to unmatured retirement schemes
?	For example, employment pensions in Alberta are now exempt at all stages in their development. Employment Pension Plans Act s. 59(1)

FL Receivables Trust 2002-A (Administrator of) v Cobrand Foods Ltd.
Facts:
-	The plaintiff, Prudential Securities Credit Corp., LLC, claimed against Robert Laba on a guarantee, and against Robert Laba and his wife, Angela Laba, on the ground that Robert's transfer of his interest in two properties to Angela were fraudulent conveyances and thus void under s. 2 of the Fraudulent Conveyances Act
-	Later, and without hearing further submissions, he delivered reasons granting Prudential judgment against Robert Laba on his guarantee in the amount of its claim, and dismissing Prudential's claim against Angela Laba
-	Both Robert Laba and Prudential have appealed 
-	On his appeal, Robert Laba makes a single submission: the trial judge failed to give him an opportunity to make closing argument ? Robert Laba submits that this failure amounted to a miscarriage of justice and must be remedied by a new trial
-	On its appeal, Prudential submits that in dismissing its action against Angela Laba, the trial judge made three errors: First, he applied the wrong legal test on a non-suit motion; Second, he applied the wrong test for establishing a fraudulent conveyance; And third, he failed to properly assess the evidence in support of Prudential's claim

C. Analysis
I. Robert Laba's Appeal
1) Did the trial judge's failure to give Robert Laba an opportunity to make closing argument amount to a miscarriage of justice?
-	Robert Laba submits that the right to make closing argument is a substantive right, essential to a fair trial ? As he was deprived of this right, albeit inadvertently, he was denied the opportunity to fully present his case
-	He points out that though he presented argument on the non-suit motion, a plaintiff's burden to defeat a non-suit differs from and is less onerous than its burden to obtain judgment on its claim ? Thus, Robert Laba contends that the result of being denied the right to make closing argument amounts to a miscarriage of justice, which can be remedied only by an order for a new trial
?	The term "non-suit" refers to a motion brought by the defendant at the close of the plaintiff's evidence to dismiss the action on the ground that the plaintiff has failed to make out a case for the defendant to answer
?	Neither the Courts of Justice Act nor the Rules of Civil Procedure specifically provides for non-suit motions, but judges continue to have a recognized jurisdiction to entertain these motions
?	Still, I question whether in this province a non-suit motion in a civil non-jury trial has much value
?	In Ontario, when a defendant moves for a non-suit, the defendant must elect whether to call evidence ? If the defendant elects to call evidence, the judge reserves on the motion until the end of the case; If the defendant elects to call no evidence — as Robert Laba elected in this case — then the judge rules on the motion immediately after it has been made
?	A non-suit motion adds to the time and expense of a trial
?	And because of the election requirement, it has little practical value
?	Perhaps a defendant bringing the motion sees a tactical advantage in being able to argue first
?	To succeed on the motion, however, the defendant must show that the plaintiff has put forward no case to answer, in most lawsuits an onerous task
?	Why not simply take on the less onerous task of showing that the plaintiff's claim should fail?
?	It is small wonder that most commentators consider that in civil judge alone trials, non-suit motions gain little and are becoming obsolete
-	In this case, I agree with Robert Laba on three points
?	First, as my discussion above signals, Prudential's burden on the non-suit motion differed from and was less onerous than its burden to obtain judgment on its claim ? To defeat the non-suit motion, Prudential had to satisfy the trial judge that it had put forward a prima facie case — that it had put forward evidence, which, if believed, would allow the trial judge to decide in its favour; To obtain judgment, Prudential, of course, had to establish its claim on a balance of probabilities
?	Second, I agree with Robert Laba that the opportunity to make closing argument is a substantive right
?	And third, I agree that though he did so inadvertently and not deliberately, the trial judge erred in depriving Robert Laba of that opportunity ? Because of this error, Robert Laba asks for a new trial
-	Not every error by a trial judge entitles an aggrieved party to a new trial ? Section 134(6) of the Courts of Justice Act stipulates that this court should order a new trial only where "some substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred"
?	This stringent standard reflects the underlying policy that new trials ordinarily are contrary to the public interest
?	New trials cause increased costs or wasted costs as well as delay in resolving disputes, and are therefore to be avoided unless plainly required by the interests of justice
-	Thus, the narrow question on this appeal is whether the trial judge's failure to give Robert Laba an opportunity to make a closing argument caused a miscarriage of justice ? I would answer that question, no
-	There are decisions of this court standing for the proposition that a litigant has a substantive right to present closing argument, and where that right is denied, we should order a new trial ? The main case, followed many times, is Felker v. Felker
?	In that case, this court held that the defendant was deprived of her substantive right to have her case fully presented because the trial judge gave judgment without giving her an opportunity to present argument
?	The court ordered a new trial.
-	In the appeal before us, I come to a different conclusion
-	In doing so, I do not intend in any way to depart from Felker and its progeny ? But, as is invariably the case, context matters
-	Here, the context includes three important considerations
?	First, Robert Laba cannot say that he had no opportunity to present argument after all the evidence was in ? To the contrary, he fully argued over the course of two and a half days all the defences to the guarantee available to him; Although he did so on his non-suit motion instead of in final argument, he nonetheless had an opportunity to fully present his side of the case; It seems to me that is all Felker requires; Indeed, the trial judge's reasons show that even on the non-suit motion, Robert Laba argued Prudential had not established its claim against him on a balance of probabilities;
?	Second, and critically important, Robert Laba has not shown that if he had been given an opportunity to make closing argument, the result would have been different; On appeal, his trial counsel filed an affidavit stating that he expected to have the opportunity to make closing submissions; But, his affidavit is silent on any new arguments that he might have presented
?	Third, when the trial judge released his reasons granting judgment, Robert Laba did not write to him or go back to him to complain that he had been prejudiced in any way by being deprived of the opportunity to make closing argument
-	In the light of these considerations, I am not persuaded that a miscarriage of justice has occurred
-	Had Robert Laba been given the opportunity to present a closing argument, I am not satisfied that the result would have been different
-	I would dismiss his appeal

II. Prudential's Appeal
1) Did the trial judge apply the wrong test on Angela Laba's non-suit motion?
-	In October 2000, Robert Laba transferred his interest in two properties to his wife, Angela ? In its action, Prudential alleged that the transfers were void because they were made with intent to defeat its claim as creditor, contrary to s. 2 of the Fraudulent Conveyances Act
-	Section 2 states:
?	Every conveyance of real property or personal property and every bond, suit, judgment and execution heretofore or hereafter made with intent to defeat, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or others of their just and lawful actions, suits, debts, accounts, damages, penalties or forfeitures are void as against such persons and their assigns
-	At the end of Prudential's case, Angela Laba moved for a non-suit, which the trial judge granted
-	Prudential submits that by doing so the trial judge applied the wrong test ? It argues that the trial judge should not have weighed the competing inferences available from the evidence to determine whether fraud had been established on a balance of probabilities; Instead, he should simply have determined whether Prudential's evidence, assuming it was believed, made out a prima facie case, a case for Angela Laba to answer
?	I agree with this submission.
-	On a non-suit motion, the trial judge undertakes a limited inquiry ? Two relevant principles that guide this inquiry are these:
?	First, if a plaintiff puts forward some evidence on all elements of its claim, the judge must dismiss the motion
?	Second, in assessing whether a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, the judge must assume the evidence to be true and must assign "the most favourable meaning" to evidence capable of giving rise to competing inferences ? This court discussed this latter principle in Hall v. Pemberton, quoting Parfitt v. Lawless:
?	I conceive, therefore, that in judging whether there is in any case evidence for a jury the Judge must weigh the evidence given, must assign what he conceives to be the most favourable meaning which can reasonably be attributed to any ambiguous statements, and determine on the whole what tendency the evidence has to establish the issue
?	From every fact that is proved, legitimate and reasonable inferences may of course be drawn, and all that is fairly deducible from the evidence is as much proved, for the purpose of a prima facie case, as if it had been proved directly
?	I conceive, therefore, that in discussing whether there is in any case evidence to go to the jury, what the Court has to consider is this, whether, assuming the evidence to be true, and adding to the direct proof all such inferences of fact as in the exercise of a reasonable intelligence the jury would be warranted in drawing from it, there is sufficient to support the issue
?	In other words, on a non-suit motion the trial judge should not determine whether the competing inferences available to the defendant on the evidence rebut the plaintiff's prima facie case
?	The trial judge should make that determination at the end of the trial, not on the non-suit motion
-	In granting Angela Laba's motion, the trial judge went beyond his limited mandate and failed to apply either of the two principles set out above
-	Ordinarily, where an appellate court reverses a decision to grant a non-suit in a judge alone trial, a new trial is ordered ? Prudential, however, does not want a new trial
-	Instead, it wants this court to decide whether the trial judge erred in concluding that it had not established that the transfers were fraudulent conveyances
-	Furthermore, although Prudential does request, in the alternative, that the case be sent back for a new trial, in my view, that remedy is not warranted as the trial judge's reasons provide a sufficient basis for this court to determine the merits of Prudential's action

2) Did the trial judge apply the wrong test for establishing a fraudulent conveyance claim?
-	The crucial question in any fraudulent conveyance action is whether the plaintiff has proved the fraudulent intent of the debtor
?	While the legal burden to prove fraudulent intent remains on the plaintiff throughout the trial, the plaintiff can raise an inference of fraud sufficient to put a "burden of explanation" on the defendant debtor
?	The plaintiff typically raises an inference of fraud by putting forward "badges of fraud" ? These "badges of fraud" vary from case to case
?	They are no more than typical and suspicious facts that may allow the court to make a finding of fraud absent an explanation from the debtor
?	The court, however, is not compelled to draw this inference of fraudulent intent from badges of fraud pleaded by the plaintiff
?	The court may dismiss a fraudulent conveyance action because it has decided that the surrounding circumstances taken as a whole explain away the plaintiff's evidence
?	It seems to me that is what the trial judge did in this case
-	It is clear from his reasons that the trial judge was well aware that it was within his discretion to draw an inference of fraudulent intent from Prudential's alleged badges of fraud
-	Unfortunately, the trial judge's reasons are not entirely clear on whether he drew this inference
-	One or two paragraphs in his judgment suggest that he did; On balance, however, on my reading of his reasons, it appears that the trial judge decided not to draw an inference of fraudulent intent and thus not to place the "burden of explanation" on Angela Laba
-	Instead, he decided Prudential's claim on the basis it had the burden of proof to establish a fraudulent conveyance on a balance of probabilities and did not have the benefit of an inference of fraudulent intent
-	He looked at all the circumstances surrounding the badges of fraud and drew inferences that explained away Prudential's evidence
-	He therefore concluded that Prudential had not made out its case
-	In my view, these passages demonstrate that the trial judge concluded, in the circumstances before him, that Prudential had not met the threshold necessary to put the burden of explanation on Angela Laba ? In my view, it was open to him to do so
-	In the next section of these reasons, I discuss the inferences that the trial judge did draw
-	On this ground of appeal, it is sufficient to say that the trial judge did not and was entitled not to draw the permissive inference of fraudulent intent
-	I am therefore not persuaded that he applied the wrong test for establishing a fraudulent conveyance

3) Did the trial judge fail to properly assess Prudential's evidence?
-	Even accepting that it had the burden throughout to establish that the transfers were fraudulent on a balance of probabilities, Prudential contends that in finding against it the trial judge failed to properly assess the evidence ? Central to this contention is Prudential's submission that, as the entire fraudulent conveyance case against Angela Laba was based on a written record, the principle of appellate deference to a trial judge's fact-finding and inference-drawing does not apply
-	The principle of deference means that an appellate court may substitute its own view of the evidence and draw its own inferences only if the trial judge committed a palpable and overriding error or made findings of fact or drew inferences that are unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence ? However, because the relevant evidence in this case is written, Prudential submits that this court may make its own findings of fact and draw its own inferences without giving any deference to the trial judge
?	That submission has been overtaken by recent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada and this court
-	The principle of appellate deference to a trial judge's fact-finding and inference-drawing applies even when the entire trial record is in writing ? That is so because the principle of deference is grounded in more than a trial judge's ability to see and hear the witnesses
-	Deference recognizes that even on a written record, the trial judge "lives through" the trial while a court of appeal reviews the record only through the lens of appellate review
-	Deference also preserves the integrity of the trial process, maintains the confidence of litigants in that process, reduces the number and length of appeals and therefore, the cost of litigation, and appropriately presumes that trial judges are just as competent as appellate judges to resolve disputes justly
-	The principle of deference, therefore, applies to the trial judge's finding that Prudential failed to establish that the transfers were fraudulent ? That finding was based on inferences the trial judge drew from the factual record; In drawing those inferences, the trial judge rejected as evidence of fraudulent intent a number of the badges of fraud put forward by Prudential
-	Thus, the only question on this branch of the appeal is whether the inferences drawn by the trial judge on which he based his ultimate finding are supported by the evidence or, I might add, by the absence of evidence put forward by Prudential ? In my view, they are
?	When the transfers took place, neither Robert Laba nor Cobrand was insolvent
?	Neither was in breach of any obligation to Captec
?	The transfers themselves gave RBC access to about the same amount of security as it would have had access to if Robert Laba had not conveyed the two properties to his wife
?	Prudential led no evidence to show or suggest that Angela Laba would have consented to the mortgage on 10 Hillview Crescent even if she had received nothing in return 
?	And, Prudential led no evidence to show that Robert and Angela Laba chose 10 Hillview Crescent with a view to defeating his creditors
-	The trial judge found that the badges of fraud put forward by Prudential did not establish a fraudulent intent on a balance of probabilities
-	In the light of the record before him, I do not think that the trial judge committed a palpable and overriding error in so finding
-	I would dismiss Prudential's appeal

D. Conclusion
-	I would dismiss both Robert Laba's appeal and Prudential's appeal ? Although the trial judge erred by not giving Robert Laba an opportunity to make a closing argument, in the context of this case, I do not think that this error caused a miscarriage of justice
-	The trial judge also erred by going beyond his limited mandate on Angela Laba's non-suit motion ? However, in dismissing the action against her, he applied the correct legal test and drew inferences that are reasonably supported by the record

February 28, 2018
Fraudulent Preferences Act
-	Under the BIA, the doctrine of pressure has been abolished but that is not the case in provincially ? Courts have disregarded this point of the BIA unfortunately
-	The provincial statute allows a debtor to pay $ to a creditor ? As long as it’s a bona fide transaction for fair market value
?	This is huge protection provided by provincial law
-	A payment of $ to a creditor can only be impeached under the BIA ? Covers the same area as the FPA and the trustee is able to get to a payment of $ under the BIA
-	Courts have also struggled with this

Christensen 
-	FPA is the provincial legislation but there is a massage limitation that limits its application
-	BIA is a lot broader than the FPA 

BIA
-	There are 2 main schemes ? Transfers at undervalue (FCA); Fraudulent preferences regime (FPA)
-	Both situations must involve transfers under value 
?	‘Transfers under value’ is defined in the BIA
-	Deal of initial bankruptcy event and date of bankruptcy ? Both of these are defined 
?	These two dates are important 
-	 If it’s arms length, the proof that you need is that the debtor was insolvent at the time the transaction was entered into OR if that particular transaction was the one that rendered the debtor insolvent & that debtor intended to defeat/delay/defraud creditors
-	If it’s not arm’s length, there are two dates (if it’s within one year (trustee has to prove nothing except that the transaction occurred) and if it’s within 5 years (insolvent at time of transaction, rendered debtor insolvent, intended to defeat/delay/defraud creditors))
?	If it’s b/w 1-5 years, you have to show the debtor was insolvent at the time OR the debtor intended to defeat/delay/defraud creditors
?	When you have a transaction b/w a debtor and a related party, you just have to show a transaction or the debtor was insolvent OR you can show proof of fraudulent intent but that’s not necessary ? Pretty easy test to meet
?	What is arm’s length? Not defined in the BIA (What BIA does is it creates a presumption s.4(5)); Have a list of people who are defined as related persons ? This is a rebuttable presumption
?	People who are in control of each other and bound by each other
?	Related means you are dealing with each other in non-arm’s-length but if you’re not related doesn’t mean you are deemed to be dealing with each other arm’s-length
?	If you’re not related, are you dealing with each other at arm’s length? This is Q of fact ? There’s a lot of case law on this 
?	Courts in general have said that if you’re influenced by something in the bargaining other than your self interest, there’s a chance you’re dealing in non-arm’s-length  
?	Courts have also looked to ITA
-	How a court can declare a transfer under value under void against the recipient of that transfer or against any other person who was privy to the transfer ? s.1
-	We have to establish values ? s.2 
-	The person who is privy to a transaction ? s.3
?	E.g. Director of the company who is privy to the transaction of the company
-	How far below fair market value does it have to be to trigger this section? ? Covers both gifts and transfers for undervalue
?	Fair market value = Trustee has to state their opinion ? The onus of proving the trustee wrong is on the recipient of the goods
?	In this case, the recipient of that good or service can come with a contrary opinion as to what the value is of that service or asset 
?	Court would have to get someone external to value the asset
?	It has to big enough to attract notice and plainly evident that there is an undervalue ? Determining value will depend on the facts of the case (so no rigid formula) ** Under the old sections, there was a test 
-	When you have a remedy, the court has a couple of options here ? Can declare the transfer void so what has happened must come back to the debtor’s estate and the court can also order a money judgment against the recipient to be put back into the debtor’s estate (against recipient or ANY PERSON privy to the recipient)

Similarities b/w old s.100 and new s.96
-	Fair market value, the conspicuous value, and judicial discretion

Standard Trustco
-	Still relevant although this case discusses s.100
-	‘May’ is permissible ? Even if you find there’s a transaction where there’s a conspicuous difference in value, the judge has a discretion to grant a remedy or to make an order under this section 
-	If you have something else, something more than simply a transaction b/w tow parties who are related, if there is something that should give rise to an equitable transaction, that’s when you determine whether the court is going to exercise that discretion 
-	Majority of the court of appeal decided that there was discretion
-	There was a very strong dissent and the NS CoA said there’s no discretion also

Peoples Department
-	SC said that you can consider equitable considerations and it’s a residual discretion 
-	As for privy, SC said it can be both a direct and indirect benefit 

4.3 BIA Transfers at Undervalue
-	Until the 2009 amendments, the relevant BIA provisions were s.91 (settlements), 100 (reviewable transactions), and 101 (dividends and redemptions of shares) ? The 2009 amendments have repealed ss. 91 and 100 and replaced them with a new s.96, dealing with gifts and transfers at undervalue
-	s.101 is unaffected
?	BIA s.101 deals w/ the purchase or redemption by a corporation of its own shares in a bankruptcy context 
?	These transactions are the functional equivalent of a gift, b/c they do not return value to the corporation; therefore, they have the potential to defeat creditors 
?	BIA s.101 supplements federal and provincial corporations laws that, generally speaking, prevent a corporation from purchasing or redeeming its shares if it is insolvent 
?	BIA s.101 also catches the declaration of a dividend at a time when the corporation is insolvent on the theory that this, too, is the functional equivalent of a gift by the corporation to its shareholders

C. The 2009 BIA Amendments
-	The 2009 amendments repeal ss.91 and 100 and replace them w/ a new s.96, governing transfers at undervalue ? “Transfers at undervalue” is defined to mean “a disposition of property or provision of services for which no consideration is received by the debtor or for which the consideration received by the debtor is conspicuously less than the fair market value of the consideration given by the debtor”
-	In summary, the main features of s.96 are:
?	The provision applies to both arm’s-length and non-arm’s-length transactions
?	In the case of an arm’s length transaction, the review period is one year before the date of the initial bankruptcy event; in the case of a non-arm’s length transaction, the review period is five years
?	In the case of an arm’s length transaction, the trustee must prove (a) that the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transaction or the transaction rendered the debtor insolvent; and b) that the debtor intended to defeat the interests of creditors
?	In the case of a non-arm’s length transaction occurring within one year before the date of the initial bankruptcy event, the trustee must prove neither that a) the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transaction or the transaction rendered the debtor insolvent; nor b) that the debtor intended to defeat the interests of creditors
?	In the case of a non-arm’s length transaction occurring b/w two and five years before the date of the initial bankruptcy event, the trustee must prove that a) the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transaction or was rendered insolvent by the transaction; or b) the debtor intended to defeat the interests of creditors
?	The trustee has a choice of remedies, either to avoid the transfer or sue the counterparty for the value shortfall
-	The application of BIA s.96 turns on the distinction b/w arm’s-length and non-arm’s length transactions 
?	BIA s.4(4) provides that it is a question of fact whether persons not related to one another were at a particular time dealing w/ each other at arm’s length 
?	S.4(5) provides that persons who are related to each other are deemed not to deal w/ each other at arm’s length while so related and that, in the context of ss.95(1)(b) and 96(1)(b), this presumption is a rebuttable one 
?	S.4(2) defines “related persons” to include, among other things, persons who are related by blood or marriage, while a person who has direct or indirect control of a corporation is a related person vis-à-vis the corporation
?	The “arms-length” concept derives from the Income Tax Act ? In Piikani Energy Corporation (Re), it was held that cases on the meaning of “arm’s-length transaction” in the ITA context are relevant also in the BIA context:
?	In McClarty v R, Rothstein J discussed the term “not delaing at arm’s length” in s.69, ITA
?	Justice Rothstein explained that the general concern in non-arm’s length transactions is that “there is no assurance that the transaction ‘will reflect ordinary commercial dealing b/w parties acting in their separate interests’
?	Thus, the ITA provisions dealing w/ non-arm’s length parties are “intended to preclude artificial transactions from conferring tax benefits on one or more of the parties”
?	While Rothstein J held that a court must consider all the relevant circumstances to determine if the parties in a transaction are at arm’s length, he also noted that the CRA Income Ta Interpretation Bulletin IT-429R2 “Meaning of Arm’s Length” contains the following “useful criteria that have been developed and accepted by courts”: i) was there a common mind which directs the bargaining for both parties to a transaction; ii) were the parties to a transaction acting in concert w/o separate interests; and iii) was there de facto control
?	We are of the view that the above mentioned factors provide helpful guidance and apply in the BIA context to determine whether, as a question of fact, two parties dealt w/ each other at arm’s length … [C]ourts should approach their task of characterizing a relationship b/w a creditor and a bankrupt in light of these principles
-	S.100 case law remains relevant b/c new s.96 is similar in many respects to the former provision ? In particular, both provisions refer to a “conspicuous disparity” b/w the fair market value of the property or services and the amount given or received for it; both provisions use permissive language, suggesting that the court has the discretion to grant relief that extends beyond the factors specifically enumerated in the provision itself; and both provisions make remedies available against a party who is privy to the transfer, in addition to the immediate parties

Standard Trustco Ltd (Trusete of) v Standard Trust Co
Facts:
-	Non-arm’s length dealings b/w related companies are deemed to be reviewable under ss.3 and 4 of the Bankruptcy Act 
-	Pursuant to s.100(1) of the Act, the court “may” inquire into the transaction at the request of the trustee ? If the inquiry proceeds and a “conspicuous” difference is revealed b/w the amount STC received and the fair market value of the property STC gave, then, under s.100(2) the court “may” order STC to make up the difference
-	According to s.100(3), the value on which the court makes a decision as to whether the transaction took place at fair market value “shall” be the values stated by the trustee in bankruptcy unless other values are proven

Issue:
-	Whether the motions judge correctly interpreted s.100, and more particularly, s.100(2) of the Act, when he declared that if there was a conspicuous difference in the fair market value received by Trustco, the trustee was entitled to judgment for the difference against STC and that there was no discretion to refuse to make the order 

Analysis;
Should an inquiry be conducted under s.100(1)?
-	Doherty JA was of the opinion that the word “may” in s.100(1) does give the court a discretion whether to conduct an inquiry or not, and that Farley J, the motions judge, recognized that he had such a discretion
?	In deciding whether the discretion should be exercised, Doherty JA agrees w/ Farley J that the intention w/ which the transaction was done and the legality of the transaction were irrelevant considerations
?	Rather, Doherty JA would recognize a discretion not to allow the action to proceed under s.100(1) only if (a) the creditors of Trustco had given their informed consent to the transaction before it occurred, b) if the trustee had been guilty of laches in pursuing a remedy against STC, or c) if to allow the inquiry to proceed would be an abuse of the court’s process
-	Agree that the exercise of discretion under s.100(1) would include equitable considerations 
-	While see no need to say that only some equitable considerations may be considered and not others, am of the opinion that s.100(1) is not the main focus of this appeal
-	This court’s interpretation of s.100(1) cannot, therefore, result in the inquiry being stopped
-	If wrong in this conclusion, would nevertheless conclude that the court’s discretion to allow the inquiry to go ahead under s.100(1) was properly exercised into this case 

Where the conditions of s.100(2) have been satisfied, does the court have a discretion as to whether to grant judgment/?
-	By virtue of s.3(1) of the Interpretation Act, the expression “may” is to be construed as permissive unless a contrary intention appears
-	I do not disagree w/ the proposition that in certain circumstances the word “may” in a statute must be taken to mean “shall”
?	But, where, as here, the word “may” as well as the word “shall” are used within s.100 the presumption that “may” is intended to be discretionary is strengthened
?	In addition, consistency of expression requires that the same words used within a section be given the same meaning
-	Once equitable considerations are found to be relevant w/ respect to s.100(1), as Doherty JA has found, consistency of interpretation requires that equitable considerations be taken into account under s.100(2)
-	When a contextual approach is adopted it is apparent that although the conditions of the section have been satisfied the court is not obliged to grant judgment 
?	This court has a residual discretion to exercise
?	The contextual approach indicates that he good faith of the parties, the intention w/ which the transaction took place, and whether fair value was given and received in the transaction are important considerations as to whether that discretion should be exercised 
-	Generally the purpose underlying s.100 is a recognition that when normal market forces do not operate, there is a loss to the bankrupt company and, as a result, the interests of creditors suffer
-	Here, however, Trustco’s lenders knew that in advance that Trustco’s original $74 million investment in STC was an investment in an industry which is regulated in the public interest for the protection of depositions and that normal market forces are not allowed to operate w/o regard ot that interest
-	They were also aware that Trustco’s $25 million injection of capital into STC at the behest of the Regulator could result in their interests being enhanced if Trustco’s already substantial investment in STC was to be saved

Dissent:
-	While I agree w. the appellants’ submission that s.100(1) and (2) contain a discretionary component and that the word “may” should be read as permissive, I cannot agree that the discretion found in either section could assist STC

Peoples Department Stores Inc (Trustee of ) v Wise
Facts:
-	In the alternative, the trustee claimed that the Wise brothers were privy to transactions in which Peoples’ assets have been transferred to Wise for conspicuously less than fair market value within the meaning of BIA s.100

Analysis:
-	Section 100 has two principal elements:
?	First, subs (1) requires the transaction to have been conducted within the year preceding the date of pregnancy 
?	Second subs (2) requires that the consideration given or received by the bankrupt be “conspicuously greater or less” than the fair market value of the property concerned
-	The words “may” is found in both ss.100(1) and (2) of the BIA w/ respect to the jurisdiction of the court
-	In Standard Trustco Ltd., the majority of the Ontario CoA held that, even if the necessary preconditions are present, the exercise of jurisdiction under s.100(1) to inquire into the transaction, and under s.100(2) to grant judgment, is discretionary ? Equitable principles guide the exercise of discretion
?	We agree
-	Referring to s.100(2) of the BIA, in Standard Trustco, Weiler JA explained that:
?	When a contextual approach is adopted it is apparent that although the conditions of the section have been satisfied the court is not obliged to grant judgment 
?	The court has a residual discretion to exercise
?	The contextual approach indicates that the good faith of the parties, the intention w/ which the transaction took place, and whether fair value was given and received in the transaction are important considerations as to whether that discretion should be exercised 
-	We agree and adopt her position ? However, this appeal does not turn on the discretion to ultimately impose liability 
?	In my view, the CoA did not interfere w/ the TJ’s exercise of discretion in reviewing the facts and finding a palpable and overriding error
?	We share the view of the CoA that it is not only the final transfers that should be considered 
-	In Skalbania (Trustee of) v Wedgewood Village Estates Ltd., the test for determining whether the difference in consideration is “conspicuously greater or less” was held to be not whether it is conspicuous to the parties at the time of the transaction, but whether it is conspicuous to the court having regard to all the relevant factors ? This is a sound approach 
?	While there is no particular percentage that definitively sets the threshold for a conspicuous difference, the percentage difference is a factor 
-	As for the factors that would be relevant to this determination, the court might consider, inter alia: evidence of the margin of error in valuing the types of assets in question; any appraisals made of the assets in question and evidence of the parties’ honest held beliefs regarding the value of the assets in question; and other circumstances adduced in evidence by the parties to explain the difference b/w the consideration received and fair market value
-	We are not satisfied that, w/ regard to all the circumstances of this case, a disparity of slightly more than 6% b/w fair market value and the consideration received constitutes a “conspicuous” difference within the meaning of s.100(2)  of the BIA ? Accordingly, we hold that the trustee’s claim under the BIA also falls 
-	In addition to permitting the court to give judgments against the other party to the transaction, s.100(2) of the BIA also permits it to give judgment against someone who was not a party but was “privy” to the transaction
?	Given the finding that the consideration for the impugned transactions was not “conspicuously less” than fair market value, there is no need to consider whether the Wise brothers would have been “privy” to the transaction for the purpose of holding them liable under s.100(2)
?	Nonetheless, the disagreement b/w the TJ and the CoA on the interpretation of “privy” in s.100(2) of the BIA warrants the following observations
-	 The primary purpose of s.100 of the BIA is to reverse the effects of a transaction that stripped value from the estate of a bankrupt person ? It makes sense to adopt a more inclusive understanding of the word “privy” to prevent someone who might receive indirect benefits to the detriment of a bankrupt’s unsatisfied creditors from frustrating the provision’s remedial purpose 
?	The word “privy” should be given a broad reading to include those who benefit directly or indirectly from and have knowledge of a transaction occurring for less than fair market value
?	In our opinion, this rationale is particularly apt when those who benefit are the controlling minds behind the transaction
-	A finding that a person was “privy” to a renewable transaction does not of course necessarily mean that the court will exercise its discretion to make a remedial order against that person ? For liability to be imposed, it must be established that the transaction occurred: a) within the past year; b) for consideration conspicuously greater or less than fair market value; c) w/ the person’s knowledge; and d) in a way that directly or indirectly benefited the person 
?	In addition, after having considered the context and all the above factors, the judge must conclude that the case is a proper one for holding the person liable
-	In light of these conditions and of the discretion exercised by the judge, find that a broad reading of “privy” is appropriate

Notes:
-	In RBC v North American Life Assurance Co, Gonthier J. held that the beneficiary designation was a settlement and that it was caught by the closing words of s.91(2) ? Consequently, the beneficiary designation was void under BIA s.91(2) and so the RRIF policy passed to Dr. Ramgotra’s trustee in bankruptcy under s.71 
?	However, by virtue of BIA s.67(1)(b) read in conjunction w/ the Saskatchewan Insurance Act, the policy was exempt property and thus not property divisible among creditors
?	Therefore, the trustee held the policy on trust for Dr. Ramgotra and had to give it back
-	According to Gonthier J, the BIA divides the trustee’s functions into two stages: a) the “property-passing” stage; and b) the “estate administration” stage
?	This distinction was central to Gonthier J’s judgment b/c it allowed him to avoid the apparent conflict b/w ss.67(1)(b) and 91
?	Gonthier J said there was no conflict b/c the two provisions belonged to different stages of the process: s.91 went to the property-passing stage, whereas s.67(1)(b) went to the estate-administration stage 
?	This reasoning is open to question on a # of grounds
?	In the first place, if the beneficiary designation was void, how could the RRIF still qualify as exempt property? The court’s answer was that if s.91(2) applies, the settlement is “void against the trustee,” but only against the trustee ? It is not void against “the claims of creditors under the provincial legislation which s.67(1)(b) incorporates”; This is a strained construction of s.91(2) which overlooks the fact that the trustee is the creditor’s representative
?	Second, on Gonthier J’s reasoning, property may vest in the trustee under s.71, but still not be property divisible among creditors ? This involves reading s.71 in isolation from s.67
?	There is no textual or historical basis for this
?	The better view is that if property is not divisible among creditors under s.67, then it does not vets in the trustee under s.71
?	Correspondingly, if property vests in the trustee pursuant to s.71, it is property divisible among creditors 
?	The 2009 amendments repealed s.91 and replaced it w/ a new s.91 ? Consequently, the parts of the case that deal specifically w/ s.91 are no longer relevant 
?	On the other hand, Gonthier J’s observations about the relationship b/w the “property-passing” provisions of the BIA and the “estate administration provisions” apply, mutatis mutandis, to the new s.96
-	The provincial courts have taken up Gonthier J’s invitation in Ramgotra to give the fraudulent conveyance laws a “broad and liberal interpretation”, where the court held that an RRSP beneficiary designation was a “disposition of property” within the meaning of the BC Fraudulent Conveyance Act
?	Would new BIA s.96 catch a beneficiary designation in an insurance policy?
?	The courts may take the view that if a beneficiary designation is a “disposition of property” for the purposes of the provincial fraudulent conveyance laws then, likewise, it is a “transfer” for the purposes of BIA s.96
?	Note, though, that new s.96 would not have applied in Ramgotra’s case ? However, the trustee would have to show either that Ramgotra was insolvent at the time of the transfer or that he intended to defeat creditors
-	The reason for Gonthier J’s strained construction in Ramgotra is that he was trying to get to what was arguably the right policy result ? In summary, the case exposes the tension b/w the debtor-rehabilitation goal of the bankruptcy laws, on the one hand, and the goals of maximizing the returns to creditors and preventing debtor fraud, on the other
?	The 2009 amendments have introduced a new s.67(1)(b.3), which provides that property in an RRSP or RRIF is exempt from seizure, w/ the exception of contributions made in the 12 months preceding the bankruptcy
-	In Ramgotra, Gonthier J, overruled provincial decisions to the contrary, held that a self-settlement (exchange of non-exempt property for exempt property) is not a “settlement” for the purposes of BIA s.91 b/c for a settlement there must be a transfer of property from one person to another
?	For similar reasons, a self-settlement would not be open to attack under the provincial fraudulent conveyance laws or the new transfers at undervalue provision in BIA s.96
?	What is there to stop a debtor from defeating creditors by taking advantage of this loophole? 
?	New BIA s.69(1)(b.3) addresses this concern in the specific context of RRSPs and RRIFs, but the 2009 amendments make no attempt to tackle the issues more generally

4.4 BIA Preferences
-	Broadly speaking, a preference is a payment of $ or transfer of property made by a debtor to a creditor on the eve of the debtor’s bankruptcy that is for a larger amount than the creditor would recover in a bankruptcy distribution ? BIA s.95 addresses this
-	The 2009 amendments made some changes to s.95
?	The new provision distinguishes b/w arm’s-length and non-arm’s-length transactions 
?	In the case of an arms-length transaction, the law is the same as before ? In particular, the trustee must prove the debtor’s intention to prefer, subject to the presumption
?	In the case of a non-arm’s-length transaction, the trustee only needs to prove that the transaction has the effect of giving the creditor a preference ? In other words, in the case of a non-arm’s-length transaction, if the transaction has the effect of giving the creditor a preference, there is, so to speak, an irrebuttable presumption that the debtor intended to prefer the creditor 
-	What is the justification for discriminating in this way b/w arm’s-length and non-arm’s-length transactions?
?	A possible explanation is that, if the parties are not at arm’s length, the debtor is more likely to have intended a preference ? However, this consideration supports at most a rebuttable presumption
?	Why should the creditor not be free to prove that, despite the parties’ relationship, the transaction was an innocent one?
-	The explanation for the resistance to an across-the-board effects-based test is concern among stakeholders, most notably the Insolvency Institute of Canada, that an effects-based test would make it too easy for the trustee to set payments aside ? In other words, the concern is with finality of transactions: if creditors cannot be sure of keeping the debtor’s repayments, this increases the risks of lending and may affect the cost and availability of credit 
?	On the other hand, if the overriding concern is really w/ the finality of transactions, then it needs to be asked whether the preference provisions should be repealed altogether 
-	There are 3 competing versions of the need for anti-preference laws: debtor deterrence, creditor deterrence, and equal sharing
?	Debtor deterrence ? The debtor should not play favorites among creditors in defiance of the bankruptcy laws: paying out friends, relatives, and business connections ahead of other creditors is wrong b/c, given the debtor’s looming bankruptcy, it deprives “other poor men of their true debts”; Another way of making the same point is to say that the debtor may not set herself up as the lawgiver in a bankruptcy distribution
?	Creditor deterrence ? We do not want creditors jumping the queue on the eve of the debtor’s bankruptcy b/c this might cause a scramble for payment, leaving only the “tag ends and remnants” of the debtor’s assets for distribution in the bankruptcy proceedings; In other words, preferential payments are inconsistent w/ the basic purpose of the bankruptcy laws
?	A related consideration is that if preferences were allowed, every creditor would want to monitor every other creditor as well as the debtor herself to make sure they were not left behind in any eve-of-bankruptcy collection race 
?	The preference laws avoid these monitoring costs
?	Equal sharing ? The purpose of the preference provisions is to make sure that all creditors are treated equally in bankruptcy; statements like this should not be taken literally, however, given the large # of exceptions to the pari passu principle
?	In real life, creditors are not treated equally in bankruptcy
?	A better statement of the equal-sharing rationale might be to say that creditors should share in accordance w/ the overall scheme of distribution the bankruptcy laws provide for
?	The key feature of the equal-sharing rationale is that it focuses on the outcome of the bankruptcy distribution, not on the debtor’s supposed fraud in giving the preference or on the creditor’s supposed fraud in receiving it 
-	The choice b/w these competing explanations is important, b/c it affects the shape of the legislation and, therefore, case outcomes

March 05, 2018
BIA Preferences
-	We’ve talked about these schemes under provincial law ? 4 schemes: Under provincial law (Fraudulent Conveyances Act, State of Elizabeth for Alberta, Fraudulent Preferences Act (Alberta) – Assignments and Preferences Act in some provinces (Ontario)) and BIA (Reviewable Transactions and Preferences))
?	Preference Provisions under the BIA are a lot more broad – they catch more things
-	Similar stuff to the provincial statute
-	It’s also similar stuff to the reviewable transactions
-	The concept of it is not new, the period is not new, but what we look for in order find a preference under the BIA is new 
-	What is a preference? It’s a payment of $ or a transfer of property made by the debtor to the creditor made on the eve of bankruptcy that is a larger among than what the creditor would have received during bankruptcy
-	Like a fraudulent conveyance, it is a transaction that defeats creditors but it is not necessarily made w/ the intent of defeating creditors
-	Preference is only fraudulent if it’s made in the eve of bankruptcy ? As opposed to a fraudulent conveyance, which can be challenge no matter when the transaction takes place ** This is important
-	A preference that is given outside of bankruptcy is not likely to be open to be challenged under fraudulent conveyances laws b/c it’s not a fraud to prefer one creditor over another
?	A preference payment is not necessarily fraudulent
-	S.95 and 96 
?	Pre-bankruptcy transactions are attacked pretty much all the time ? B/c bankruptcy is a period when a debtor cannot pay its creditors the $ that they’re owed so this becomes two of the most provisions in the bankruptcy Act
?	The problem w/ these regimes is that they’re quite uncertain ? Trustee can rely on the provincial legislation and it’s slightly different b/w provinces and we don’t know when the trustee is going to rely on them
-	When a debtor is solvent, creditors can expect to receive payment in full ? If not, they can go after the debtor outside of bankruptcy
-	Preference proceedings focus on the onset of insolvency and bankruptcy
-	The thing about preference provisions is that sometimes some creditors impose a lot of pressure on the debtor ? These creditors may know the debtor is on its way to bankruptcy so it may exert pressure over them
-	Preference law is a transitional rule designed to prevent individual creditors from opting out of the collective proceeding once the event becomes likely ? it is an attempt to ameliorate the effects of a common pool problem that justifies a collective proceeding 
-	“Major policy is that the bankrupt’s property is to be divided ratably among his creditors”
-	It is really important for the trustee to have the ability to reach back before bankruptcy and claw some of that property back into the bankrupt’s estate 
-	Compelling policy objectives: Debtor deterrence v Creditor deterrence v Equality
?	Not only seek to deter the debtor, also seek to deter the creditor who might have some knowledge of the advancing bankruptcy ? Prevents these creditors who would otherwise get undue benefits
?	Our statute now says it doesn’t matter if there’s pressure by the creditor ? Not taking into that account when determining whether creditor should pay the payment or not 
?	This is seeking to deter creditor from doing it 
?	Pressure still works its way into this scheme and courts DO consider pressure that the creditor has given 
?	We are focusing on the actions of the creditor and we’re making sure that we deter creditors’ opportunistic behaviour
?	Regime based on equality ? Doesn’t matter of creditor knew debtor was insolvent, or exerted pressure, etc. none of that matters
-	Fundamentally our regime is concerned w/ debtor deterrence but is also concerned with equality to a certain extent 
?	Absolute equality regime would require every transaction made would be set aside ? This ignore reasons for why this transaction was made
-	We only care about transactions only if the debtor intended to prefer that creditor
-	In the provision, what you’re seeking to set aside, it doesn’t have any connection to the purpose of the entire scheme 
-	What matters to creditors is the fair distribution of the debtor’s assets ? Doesn’t care about what the debtor was trying to do
-	The US has tried to create an equality-based regime
-	In our regime, for arm’s length transaction, we care about the debtor’s transactions, for non-arm’s length, we don’t care about the debtor’s transaction
-	Difference b/w conveyance and preference
?	Transfer or disposition of property that defeats or hinders creditors
?	Selective transfer of property to creditor but it’s not intended to defeat creditors ? If the debtor is insolvent, that’s when the problem arises 
-	A lot of the conveyances that are made, are made to friends, family, companies that the debtor has (related parties)
?	The point of a conveyance is to hinder creditors and put it out of reach of creditors and so the debtor can get the property back once the financial mass has passed
?	Maybe the debtor knows creditors are coming after him so he wants to leave his property with his children (may not even want the property back)
?	Intention to move the property out of the reach of creditors ? This is what makes it fraudulent
-	A preference payment is not intended to defeat creditors and there is no fraud there
?	This is a selective transfer of property to creditors
?	What happens is the creditor who receives that property is getting more before bankruptcy than what they would have gotten during bankruptcy
-	Arm’s Length
?	The debtor must have intended to give the creditor a preference
?	The conveyance must meet timing requirements
-	Non-Arm’s Length
?	Can be dealing w/ each other at non-arm’s length even if they’re not related
?	This is a question of fact

Piikani Energy Corporation
-	Why is it important if the parties are at arm’s length or not? Whether you had a certain intention or not and the review period
?	If at arm’s length, review period is not nearly as long (3 months vs. 12 months for non-arm’s length)
?	If these are arm’s length transactions, a preference payment arises in fact ? Voidable against the trustee; whereas for an arm’s-length party, you have this intention that has to come up (debtor intention is relevant here)
-	How do you define arm’s length?
?	Not defined in the BIA so the court looked to the ITA 
-	Are directors presumed to be acting at arm’s length with the corporation?
?	Directors are in fact presumed to be at arm’s length with the company
?	CBCA has a presumption that directors are acting at arm’s length with the company ? Bu this doesn’t mean this applies every time 
-	What about in this case?
?	Here the parties were at arm’s length
-	You have to look at the situation that’s occurring
?	Legally, a director’s at arm’s length but factually that may not be the case ? Same with key employees
?	Consider the facts in every circumstance
?	Look at both the relationship in general and the control that director had on that transaction

BIA
-	Start at s.95(2) ? If the transfer had the effect of giving creditor preference, it is presumed to have made w/ the view to giving creditor preference
?	Trustee proves 3 factual things
?	Once this presumption arises and the creditor can rebut the presumption 
-	S.95(1)(a) ? Has an intention (arm’s length)
?	Subsection (a) and subsection (2) are related
?	Courts have always interpreted this to be the intention of the debtor
?	Dominant intent
?	Only the debtor’s intention that’s relevant and not the creditor’s intention
?	If it’s shown that transaction had preferential effect, it will be presumed debtor intended to prefer a creditor ? Evidentiary burden shifts to the creditor
?	In order to rebut the presumption, what you say has to be objectively reasonable ? Not only from debtor’s state of mind (Must be a reasonably held intention)
?	If trustee has proved the 3 elements, the trustee’s job is done and the creditor must then prove that the dominant intention was to NOT give a preference 
-	(b) ? No intention (non-arm’s length)
-	Under s.136 ? Landlord would be a preferred creditor for 3 months of rent
-	Paying $ under a security interest, you are not preferring that creditor ? Not prejudicing other creditors
?	However, if you convert a previously unsecured debt to secured debt and then pay, that would be a preference payment
-	Example ? This is common as debtors find that they are unable to pay and so they’ll find a creditor and order large amounts of goods to either fall under the general security agreement or to use those goods and sell and pay other creditors that may exist
?	You’ll have a debtor who really doesn’t know what to do
?	Makes sense sometimes to buy a large # of goods and sell some of these goods to get these creditors off my back
?	A lot of these stuff doesn’t come with bad intentions but has a bad effect
?	This should be a preference (b/c you’re preferring your existing creditor over the new creditor you will have) ? The transfer to the secured creditor occurred when the debtor acquired property and the time the debtor acquired property (interest attaches to the goods as debtor acquires right to the goods) 
?	Trustee here would have the benefit of the statutory presumption ? Secured creditor can rebut that presumption if it could show that these transactions occurred in the ordinary course of the debtor’s business
?	Unusually large purchases of goods, in and of itself, tells you it’s not in the ordinary course of business
-	The conveyance of exempt property in this period, does not fall under the preference provisions ? It is the debtor’s property to begin with
-	Must be proved that debtor is an insolvent person at the date of the alleged transaction (s.2 defines insolvent person)
?	Trustee has the onus
-	Must be shown that as a result of the conveyance transfer payment that the creditor in fact received a preference
?	Must be to a creditor ? If not, these provisions don’t apply and then you’re into the potential reviewable transaction provisions, fraudulent conveyance law
?	It’s not whether the person’s a creditor after the payment, it’s before the payment
?	Must be shown that effect of payment, at the date it was made, was to give a creditor preference
-	S.95(3) ? Expands definition of creditor

Hudson v Benallack
Issue:
-	Whether the words ‘with a view to giving such creditor a preference” contained in s.73(1) of the Bankruptcy Act require only an intention on the part of the insolvent debtor to prefer or a concurrent intent n the part of both debtor and creditor [BIA s.95]

Analysis:
-	There is a wide divergence of opinion ? There are many decisions in which it has been held that concurrent intent must be proved; others in which it has been held that the Court is concerned only w/ the intent of the debtor; and still others in which the point has been left unresolved
-	Although the Courts of the country appear divided, more or less evenly, on the need for a concurrent intent before invalidating a transaction, the textbook writers and commentators do not evidence such divergence of opinion
?	The editors of Duncan & Honsberger ? s.64 (now s.73) makes no reference to the view of the creditor and that the cases in England and in the other Dominions on corresponding sections in Bankruptcy Acts contain no reference to the view of the creditor, the view of the debtor alone being considered 
?	The editors of Houlden & Morawetz ? In view of the plain meaning of s.73, the concurrent intent of both debtor and creditor is not necessary to show a fraudulent preference; the intention of the debtor alone is to be considered
?	Bradford 7 Greenberg ? Authors cite “an intention on the part of the debtor to prefer” as one of the two circumstances constituting a fraudulent preference
-	If this Court is free to decide the issue of concurrent intent untrammelled by earlier decisions, there would seem to be at least 3 reasons why we should not engraft upon s.73 of the Bankruptcy Act an additional concept, that of concurrent intent: first, the policy of the Bankruptcy Act; second, the history of the Act; third, the language of s.73
?	The object of the bankruptcy law is to ensure the division of the property of the debtor rateably among all his creditors in the event of his bankruptcy ? s.112 of the Act provides that, subject to the Act, all claims proved in the bankruptcy shall be paid pari passu
?	The Act is intended to put all creditors upon an equal footing
?	Generally, until a debtor is insolvent or has an act of bankruptcy in contemplation, he is quite free to deal w/ his property s he wills and he may prefer one creditor over another but, upon becoming insolvent, he can no longer do any act out of the ordinary course of business which he has the effect of preferring a particular creditor over other creditors
?	If one creditor receives a preference over other creditors as a result of the debtor acting intentionally and in fraud of the law, this defeats the equality of the bankruptcy laws
?	The cognizance of the creditor or its absence should be irrelevant ? One can sympathize w/ the rationale of concurrent intent, which is the desire to protect an innocent creditor who accepts payment of a debt in good faith, but it is hard to reconcile this point of view w/ the language of the statute, w/ the history of bankruptcy legislation, and w/ the right of other innocent creditors to equal protection
-	Concluded that a finding of concurrent intent is not necessary in order to set aside a payment as a fraudulent preference under s.73 of the Bankruptcy Act ? Do not believe that the decision of this Court in Benallack v Bank of British North America is authoritative in interpreting s.73 of the Bankruptcy Act 
?	However similar may be the wording, do not think that a phrase in a provincial territorial Ordinance of three paragraphs dealing w/ preferential assignments and having a particular legislative history and jurisprudence should govern the language of a federal Act of some 213 sections dealing with bankruptcy and having an entirely different legislative history and jurisprudence
-	Our duty is to construe the language of s.73 of the Bankruptcy Act within the ambit and policy of that Act; if we go to the words of the statute we find that what is to be considered as fraudulent and void is: “Every conveyance … of property” (i.e., the assignment in favour of respondents) “… made by any insolvent person” “in favour of any creditor” … with a view to giving such creditor a preference …
-	It seems plain from the quoted words that the view, the only view, w/ which s.73(1) of the Act is concerned is that of the insolvent person making the conveyance and we should not be diverted to any other conclusion by reliance upon a case in which a different statute in different language was construed 
-	Whether or not a conveyance or payment is a fraudulent preference depends entirely on the intention of the debtor

Orion Industries Ltd. v Neil’s General Contracting
Facts:
-	This is an appeal of a bankruptcy judge’s refusal to set aside a payment made by a company to one of its creditors on the eve of company’s bankruptcy
-	The trustee in bankruptcy had applied for a declaration that the payment to the respondent creditor was void by virtue of s.95(1)(a) of the BIA

Analysis:
-	S.95(1)(a) provides that a payment made by an insolvent person to a creditor w/ a view to giving that creditor a preference is void as against the trustee in bankruptcy
-	S.95(2) of the BIA provides that if a payment to a creditor has the effect of giving that creditor a preference, it will be presumed to have been made w/ a view to giving a voidable preference unless there is evidence establishing that the payment was not made w/ the view to giving that creditor a preference over other creditors
-	The term “fraudulent preference” has sometimes been used in this context ? Obviously, if the preference is fraudulent, it is voidable
?	However, in Piikani Energy Corporation, Justice Graesser suggested that the use of the term “fraudulent” is sometimes inappropriate ? We agree
?	Using the term “fraudulent preference” may wrongly impugn the integrity of the creditor receiving the payment b/c it may not know that it is being paid in preference to others 
?	It may also wrongly impugn the integrity of the debtor making the payment b/c it may not know that its destiny, within the next three months, is bankruptcy
?	As Justice Graesser pointed out, neither may be aware that bankruptcy is imminent when the payment is made 
?	Also, when the payment is made, it may not be apparent to either party that the payment in fact gives a preference to the recipient creditor over other creditors 
?	That is, the fact that such payment has had the effect of conferring a preference may only be apparent w/ the benefit of hindsight
?	Sometimes, of course, only the insolvent debtor knows that a preference is being given
?	The creditor receiving the payment does not 
-	A preferable phrase to describe these potentially voidable payments is “preferential payment” ? Preferential payments are those which in fact confer a preference on one creditor over another
?	Preferential payments are not voidable per se
?	Only those preferential payments made w/ a view to giving the preference are voidable at the instance of the trustee
?	But if the payment confers a preference in fact, the presumption will be that the payment was intended to confer the preference
?	And if the presumption is not rebutted, the payment will be void as against the trustee
-	Here it is acknowledged that the impugned payment gave the respondent creditor a preference over other creditors
-	It is also acknowledged that this occurred within 3 months of the insolvent company’s bankruptcy ? So there was no doubt that the payment was a preferential payment capable of being set aside at the instance of the trustee in the absence of evidence that it was not made w/ a view to giving the preference
-	The issue before the bankruptcy judge and on appeal was whether the creditors which received the preferential payment had rebutted the presumption in section 95(2) of the BIA, namely the presumption that a payment which has the effect of giving a preference is presumed to be a payment made w/ a view to giving a preference ? The issue was then whether there was “evidence to the contrary”, i.e., evidence that the payment was not made w/ a view to giving a preference or, put another way, evidence that the payment was not intended to be preferential
-	It is settled law that the onus or burden of rebutting the presumption in s.95(2) is on the creditor receiving the preferential payment
?	Discharging that burden is difficult b/c the creditor receiving the payment may not know what motivated the payment
?	And though the onus is on the creditor receiving the payment to rebut the presumption of preference, it is the intention of the insolvent debtor which governs
-	It is also settled law that a payment made in the ordinary course of business, such as those made to discharge debts incurred in the conduct of the bankrupt’s business, will not be found to have been made w/ a view to giving a preference ? If it can be established that the preferential payment was made in the ordinary course of the bankrupt’s business, the presumption that the payment was made w/ a view to giving a preference will be rebutted
?	What constitutes a payment made in the ordinary course of business is fact dependent
?	But, payments made to purchase goods or services required for the on-going conduct of the bankrupt’s business have been found to be payments made in the ordinary course of business
?	Payments made to honor contractual obligations allowing the insolvent to carry on business have been found to be payments made in the ordinary course of business
?	And even a preferential payment made by an insolvent company at a time when its financial collapse is inevitable may be found to be legitimate if the payment was made with a view to generating income or liquidating assets to satisfy the insolvent’s creditors
-	Having considered the foregoing evidence and the parties’ arguments, the bankruptcy judge found that the section 95(2) statutory presumption that the preferential payment was made with a view to giving the creditor which received the payment a preference had been rebutted ? That is, the bankruptcy judge found that the evidence to the contrary rebutted the presumption that the preferential payment was intended to give a preference
-	We see no palpable or overriding error in that finding
-	The bankruptcy judge found that the “dominant intent” of the insolvent company in making the payment was “to ensure that a certain valuable asset ... could be protected because they (the insolvent company) wanted to liquidate it and hopefully get their money back” 
-	The bankruptcy judge found that to be a legitimate and sensible business decision
-	The New Brunswick Court of Appeal’s decision in St Anne-Nackawic is instructive ? There the Court held that when the insolvent debtor paid one creditor at the expense of others for the purposes of generating income to pay a secured creditor of the insolvent debtor, the payment was not a voidable preference
?	The Court of Appeal set aside the bankruptcy judge’s declaration, holding that the evidence disclosed that the payment was not made with a view to giving the creditor a preference over other creditors, but rather was intended to generate income which income would be available to satisfy the claims of the secured creditor
?	While the Court of Appeal did not articulate a test for determining whether a payment is made with a view to giving a preference, it did consider what the trustee might have done had the impugned payment not been made by the insolvent prior to bankruptcy
?	The Court of Appeal was of the view that the trustee might well have made the payment it was now attacking because it would have generated much needed income for the bankrupt
-	That analysis is instructive ? What would the trustee have done with the funds used to pay the preferred creditor in this appeal? Assuming the trustee had no better information than the financial officer of the insolvent company had at the time of the impugned payment, it might well have paid the creditor with a view to generating income by freeing up a stored asset for a possible sale
-	The bankruptcy judge concluded that the payment was commercially necessary in order to secure access to an asset which could be sold to generate revenue and it was therefore not made with a view to giving a preference. That conclusion must be accorded deference
-	But, to address the appellant’s argument, the absence of an actual or pending sale did not make the purpose of the payment, or the intention of the insolvent debtor in making it, objectively unreasonable ? The payment might well have paved the way for the generation of income and certainly removed an obstacle to generating income; Had the payment not been made, the very least that could be said is that the prospects of selling the asset would have been diminished
-	This raises the issue of “pressure” ? As previously set out, section 95(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act provides that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, a payment which has the effect of giving a creditor a preference is presumed to have been made with a view to giving the preference, even if made under pressure
?	The section also provides that evidence of pressure is not admissible to validate a preferential payment
?	So, evidence of pressure cannot be used to rebut the presumption that a preferential payment was made with a view to giving the preference and therefore voidable
-	It may not, strictly speaking, be necessary for us to deal with the pressure argument because if there is evidence rebutting the presumption that a preferential payment was made with a view to giving the preference, then the fact that there might also have been evidence of pressure is irrelevant
-	Evidence of pressure, of course, cannot be adduced to rebut the presumption of preference; but in this case there was evidence independent of the pressure evidence which was found to rebut the presumption ? There is nothing in the bankruptcy judge’s reasons or in his exchanges with counsel to suggest that he relied on the evidence of pressure which was argued on appeal to support his finding that the presumption had been rebutted
-	However, in addition to the evidence of the pressure of the threat or perceived threat that the insolvent company’s delinquencies would be reported to its largest customer, there was also the evidence of the creditor’s insistence that it be paid before access to the asset would be given ? That evidence might also be construed as evidence of pressure and the bankruptcy judge did rely on that evidence as rebutting the presumption that a preference was intended
-	However, the bankruptcy judge characterized that evidence not as evidence of pressure but rather as evidence of a normal business imperative
-	Prior to the enactment of Canada’s bankruptcy legislation, a payment by an insolvent debtor which had the effect of giving one or more of the debtor’s creditors a preference over other creditors was not voidable if it were made under pressure ?The rationale for this judicial exception to the rule that preferential payments by insolvent debtors were voidable (in those days at the instance of the insolvent debtor’s creditors) was that the conferring of a preference necessarily involved a voluntary act
?	The making of a payment under pressure was not considered to be a voluntary act
?	Indeed, a creditor’s mere demand for payment was sufficient to show that the payment was involuntary and therefore not voidable
-	Then, Canada’s first bankruptcy legislation, in 1919, prohibited pressure as a factor capable of validating an otherwise voidable preferential payment ? Likewise, under today’s Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, pressure cannot be invoked to rebut the presumption that a preferential payment to a creditor was made with a view to giving a preference; Indeed, evidence of pressure is inadmissible
-	The question then is, was the evidence that the respondent creditor would not release the asset unless it was paid, evidence of pressure and therefore inadmissible and not capable of validating an otherwise preferential payment? Or, was it simply evidence of a commercial imperative which required the payment to be made in order to generate income? 
-	The answer, of course, depends upon how the evidence is characterized; And characterizing such evidence is something upon which reasonable people can disagree
-	The bankruptcy judge characterized the evidence of the insolvent company’s desire to realize upon its asset as a reasonable response to a financial imperative
-	The amount of income hoped to be generated by liquidating the asset was considerably greater than the cost of paying the creditor
-	Also, if the asset had been sold for the price the insolvent debtor thought it could fetch, the income generated might have gone a long way toward saving the insolvent company from bankruptcy
-	For those reasons, we find that the bankruptcy judge’s characterization of the evidence was reasonable and entitled to deference
-	In the result, the trustee’s appeal is dismissed

Piikani Energy Corporation
Facts:
-	Thisis an appeal by 607385 Alberta Ltd. and Dale McMullen from a chambers judge’s ruling in favour of Alger & Associates Inc. (now Grant Thorton Alger Inc.), Trustee in Bankruptcy of Piikani Energy Corporation
-	Alger alleges that certain payments by Piikani Energy to 607 and McMullen were fraudulent preferences and brought an application to set them aside and recover these funds 

Issue:
-	Did the chambers judge err in holding that McMullen and Ho Lem were not at arm’s length to Piikani Energy when those payments were made?
-	Did the chambers judge err in holding that Piikani Energy was insolvent when it made the impugned payments?

Analysis:
-	S.4 “related presons” and s.95(1) and (2) were cited
-	The 2009 amendment of the BIA created a distinction b/w arm’s length and non-arm’s length creditors, which is significant to this appeal for two reasons:
?	First, whether a transaction is at arm’s length determines how much of the period before bankruptcy is under scrutiny
?	An arm’s length transaction is reviewable if it occurred within three months before the initial bankruptcy event, while a non-arm’s length transaction is reviewable within a year before that event
?	The timing of the 607 and McMullen payments in this appeal was more than three months, but less than 12 months before the bankruptcy ? Therefore, if the payments were at arm’s length, they are not subject to review
?	Second, the amendments eliminate the question of intent for preferences between non-arm’s length parties
?	Before 2009, the fact that an insolvent person’s transaction led to a preference in fact gave rise to a presumption that the insolvent person intended that result. But the presumption of intent was rebuttable under section 95(2) 
?	In the case of arm’s length parties, it still is
?	However, since the 2009 amendments, intent is no longer a legally-required component of a preference between non-arm’s length parties
?	If a preference arises in fact between non-arm’s length parties, it is simply void as against the trustee

(ii) Meaning of “arm’s length”
-	The term “arm’s length” is not defined in the BIA
-	In our view, the jurisprudence under the ITA provides appropriate principles for determining whether two parties dealt at arm’s length
?	As a starting point, we note that the definitions of “related persons” and “arm’s length” are either similar or identical in ss 4, BIA and s 251(2), ITA
?	When the terms “control” and “arm’s length” were incorporated into the BIA, they already existed in the ITA
?	Panfab Corp., Re ? In that case, the court had to decide whether “control” had the same meaning as in the ITA context and Justice Houlden held that when Parliament chose to incorporate the term in the BIA, when its meaning had been well-established by case law, it “must have intended to adopt that definition when it used almost identical wording in the Bankruptcy Act”
?	In our view, a similar logic applies to the term “arm’s length”
?	Moreover, one of the key cases in defining “arm’s length” in the BIA context drew on the ITA for interpretive guidance: Gingras, Robitaille, Marcoux Ltée v Beaudry (sub nom. Tremblay, Re)
?	Although Tremblay is sometimes discussed as though it defined the term “arm’s length” uniquely in the BIA context, Moisan J in fact formulated his definition by referring to s 69, ITA
?	Further, the British Columbia Court of Appeal also looked to ITA cases to interpret the meaning of “arm’s length” in Skalbania (Trustee of ) v Wedgewood Villages Estates Ltd.
-	In addition, defining “arm’s length” consistently regardless of whether it appears in the BIA or ITA accords with the view that courts may consider the legislature’s “statute book” in giving meaning to a term ? This approach relies on the logical assumption that Parliament knows what other statutes say when it passes an enactment, and perhaps even more so when it amends a statute (i.e. the BIA) to incorporate a term that has been defined in the courts in another context (i.e. the ITA)
?	This approach also minimizes the potential for unnecessary conflicts in interpretation
?	The Supreme Court recognized the utility of this principle in R v Ulybel Enterprises Ltd, citing Ruth Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes:
?	The meaning of words in legislation depends not only on their immediate context but also on a larger context which includes the Act as a whole and the statute book as a whole
?	The presumptions of coherence and consistency apply not only to Acts dealing with the same subject but also, albeit with lesser force, to the entire body of statute law produced by a legislature
?	Therefore, other things being equal, interpretations that minimize the possibility of conflict or incoherence among different enactments are preferred
-	In McClarty v R, Rothstein J discussed the term “not dealing at arm’s length” in s 69, ITA
?	Justice Rothstein explained that the general concern in non-arm’s length transactions is that “there is no assurance that the transaction ‘will reflect ordinary commercial dealing between parties acting in their separate interests’”
?	Thus, the ITA provisions dealing with non-arm's length parties are “intended to preclude artificial transactions from conferring tax benefits on one or more of the parties”
?	While Rothstein J held that a court must consider all the relevant circumstances to determine if the parties in a transaction are at arm’s length, he also noted that the Canada Revenue Agency Income Tax Interpretation Bulletin IT-419R2 “Meaning of Arm’s Length” (June 8, 2004) contains the following “useful criteria that have been developed and accepted by the courts”: (i) was there a common mind which directs the bargaining for both parties to a transaction; (ii) were the parties to a transaction acting in concert without separate interests; and (iii) was there de facto control
-	We are of the view that the above mentioned factors provide helpful guidance and apply in the BIA context to determine whether, as a question of fact, two parties dealt with each other at arm’s length
-	While some of the definitions offered in past case law, including Tremblay and Skalbania, might contain helpful illustrations of these concepts, courts should approach their task of characterizing a relationship between a creditor and a bankrupt in light of these principles

(iii) Are directors presumed to be non-arm’s length with the corporation they serve?
-	While a director might frequently not be at arm’s length with the corporation, the Business Corporations Act, RSA 2000, c. B-9 recognizes that this is not invariably the case ? Section 102 of the Business Corporations Act generally requires a director to disclose any conflicts of interest, and to refrain in voting on any related director's resolutions; But the Act recognizes a number of exceptions:
?	102(6) A director referred to in subsection (1) shall not vote on any resolution to approve the contract or transaction unless the contract or transaction is [...] (b) a contract or transaction relating primarily to the director’s remuneration as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or an affiliate, [...]
?	Section 102(6)(b) recognizes that when directors are negotiating their own compensation (or severance arrangements) their interests are recognizably adverse to those of the corporation ? So long as the corporation is represented by independent individuals, the director would be dealing at arm’s length in such negotiations
-	Thus, the fact that a creditor is a director of a company is not in itself a conclusive indicator that he is not acting at arm’s length ? If Parliament had intended to establish such a presumption, it could easily have done so by including directors within the definition of “related parties”

(iv) Were Ho Lem and McMullen at arm’s length with Piikani Energy?
-	The burden of proving preferential treatment was on the Trustee
-	The chambers judge had limited evidence before him of how the decisions to pay Ho Lem and McMullen arose
-	In our view, the chambers judge erred in concluding that McMullen and Ho Lem were nonarm’s length with Piikani Energy ? It is difficult to understand how he reached this conclusion in the absence of evidence about Ho Lem’s and McMullen’s specific roles in making the impugned payments, particularly where Ho Lem and McMullen were only two of five directors and where another director signed McMullen’s termination letter
-	The fact that Ho Lem and McMullen were directors and key employees of Piikani Energy does not on its own lead to the conclusion that they were not acting at arm’s length in relation to Piikani Energy with respect to the disputed payments
-	The chambers judge himself noted that the only evidence about the circumstances of the payments came from Ho Lem and McMullen; there is no suggestion that this evidence was contradicted
-	Nonetheless, the chambers judge disregarded this evidence and concluded that Ho Lem and McMullen were non-arm’s length by reference to their directorship and the timing of the payments
-	This, in our view, is a reviewable error

Conclusion
-	The appeal is allowed, the judgments against the appellants are set aside, and the application of the Trustee is dismissed

March 07, 2018
How does the creditor rebut the presumption?
-	If a creditor can show, on a balance of probabilities, that the dominant intent of the debtor was in fact not to prefer that creditor, then the application by the trustee to bring that $ back into the estate will be dismissed 
-	If the creditor fails to do that, the creditor has not rebutted the presumption and will not be able to keep the $$
-	This is very fact specific inquiry but it is possible to identify certain reoccurring things
-	There are generally 13 different categories that show patterns that occur under case law ? It’s possible to put all those categories into essentially 4 categories:
?	One of the main categories is the ordinary course of business exception ? If you can show the payment was made in the ordinary course of business, you can rebut the presumption
?	The Pacific Mobile Case talks about what ordinary course of business means ? Debtor can continue paying regular payments to its suppliers, landlord, to its employees so it’s really important to note that once the debtor becomes insolvent, although any payment it makes during that period is going to be examined, doesn’t meant they can’t pay any payments
?	Continuing in Business
?	Creditor Diligence Defence?
Pacific Mobile
-	Just b/c payments are made past the due date, doesn’t mean they’re made outside the ordinary course of business
-	Concepts that concern us is an abstract one
-	Must look at the qualify of the given transaction
-	CoA looked at various things b/w the debtor and creditor: 1) relationship b/w the two; 2) payment history from the debtor to the creditor; 3) industry evidence; 4) the creditor’s response throughout the 4 years
-	The creditor submitted evidence that the creditor itself believed it was made in the ordinary course of business ? Court said this doesn’t matter
-	It’s up to the court to decide what the ordinary course of business means 
-	CoA takes a wide view for ordinary course of business ? Looks at what is the ordinary course of business b/w these two parties and what is the ordinary course of business in this particular industry
-	Here, the payment was late but it reflected the ordinary course of business b/w the two parties ? Just b/c it’s late doesn’t mean it’s necessarily out of the ordinary course of business 
-	If payment is always early throughout the 4 years and then suddenly you have a payment that’s late, then there’s a red flag
-	SC upheld the CoA ? Upheld that this is a factual inquiry: 1) local context b/w the creditor and debtor; 2) industry practice 

Canadawide Fruit
-	TJ erred in finding that the trustee had to prove intention ? Trustee has to prove the 3 elements but not intention
?	Upon proving these three elements, the assumption of intention arises
-	THEN it’s at that point the creditor has to rebut the presumption
-	It will be outside the ordinary course of business where the debtor has adopted a policy of only paying certain creditors ? But when the transfer was made w/ the dominant intent to stay in business, then the presumption is rebutted
-	A mere statement by the debtor is not enough ? There has to be credible evidence in addition to that assertion

Ramsey
-	The evidence provided explanations as to why the bankrupt ordered his affairs like that but the explanations were, again, not objectively reasonable
-	Good example as to why there needs to be an air of reality

Logistec Stevedoring (Atlantic) Inc v AC Poirier & Associates Inc.
-	Relevant factors are good for assessing the debtor’s dominant intent
-	It’s settled law that the creditor’s knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time is irrelevant ? On the other hand, it is relevant that the corporate debtor knew of its own insolvency at the date of the payment
-	BUT it’s no defence to an allegation that the creditor exerted pressure on the debtor to secure the payment ? This is still in question
-	The test of dominant intent is objective
-	The reason that this payment was made so that this asset could be applied in order to maximize the return for this secured creditor 
-	In a bankruptcy, the secured creditor is getting paid first ? If something is maximizing the account of the secured creditor, that is not a preference payment
-	When we’re talking about preferring one creditor over another, we’re talking about unsecured creditors
-	If a debtor is paying a secured creditor during the time it’s insolvent, that’s not a preference payment
-	By paying logistecs specifically, something happened in the business that maximized the return of their secured credit 
-	Yes it was for 1 day but by making the payment, the debtor was nonetheless acting in the best interest of all those concerned when making that payment to Logistecs
-	Fundamentally what the court looks at is ‘does this payment make good commercial sense?’ ? Did it continue the business, benefit the other creditors? 
-	Was this decided b/c of the presence of the secured creditor?

What if creditor exerts pressure on debtor for debtor to pay?
-	95(2) ? Evidence of pressure is not admissible to support a fraudulent preference transaction 
-	The problem is even by doing so, the point of this clause is Parliament wanted to eradicate the doctrine of pressure but it hasn’t been successful b/c the doctrine of pressure is really ingrained in case law and how the courts approach these cases

Re Norris
-	 Eminent crisis test (to the debtor) ? Not all courts have accepted this 

Canadawide Fruit Wholesalers Inc. (Trustee of ) v Hapco Farms Inc
Appliable Law
-	s.95(1) of the BIA concerning fraudulent preferences provides that every payment made by any insolvent person in favour of any creditor w/ a view to giving that creditor a preference over the other creditors shall, if the person making it becomes bankrupt within 3 months after the date of making it, be deemed fraudulent and void as against the trustee in the bankruptcy
-	Subsection (2) provides that where any payment mentioned in subsection (1) has the effect of giving any creditor a preference over other creditors, or over any one or more of them, it shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have been made w/ a view to giving the creditors a preference over other creditors
-	In other words if, in the three-month period prior to the bankruptcy of his debtor, one creditor is paid over other creditors, that payment is presumed to be preferential ? The onus is on the creditor to prove he was not paid by preference, but in the ordinary course of his debtor’s business 
-	If the creditor fails to satisfy the Court that the payment was made in the ordinary course of his debtor’s business, the payment is considered fraudulent (a legal or constructive fraud) and void as against the trustee

Analysis:
-	Houlden and Morawetz comment on s.95 of the BIA as follows:
?	Under s.95 the trustee is required to prove: 1) that the conveyance, transfer, payment, etc., took place within 3 months or one year of bankruptcy; 2) that the debtor was an insolvent person at the date of the alleged preference; and 3) that at the date whenthe conveyance, transfer, payment, etc., was made, it gave the creditor a preference in fact over other creditors
?	When the trustee has proved these three essentials, s.95(2) provides that the conveyance, transfer, payment, etc., is presumed to have been made w/ a view to giving the creditor a preference over other creditors
-	In the instant case, the three conditions mentioned above have been met
?	The TJ erred at law when he required the trustee to first establish the debtor’s intention to prefer for subsection 95(2) to apply
?	Also find, as a matter of law, that the trustee had no more to do than simply prove a preference in fact
?	In this case the evidence quite obviously demonstrates that Hapco was paid, while other creditors were not 
-	Since the trustee has established the necessary conditions for the prima facie presumption of subsection 95(2) to apply, the onus should properly have rested on Hapco to prove, by balance of probabilities, that the payments were not fraudulent, b/c they were not made w/ a view to prefer
?	There are a # of ways to achieve this
?	The authors Houlden and Morawetz list 13 examples ? The TJ seems to have considered two, i.e., that the payments were intended to keep the company in business and that they were made in the ordinary course of business
-	The TJ held that Canadawide had adopted a policy of paying only the claims of its creditors who were prepared to continue trading with it, so as to continue tis operations ? These payments were made in the pursuit of this policy and were intended to keep Canadawide in business
?	The trustee argues that Hapco knew of Canadawide’s insolvency at the time the payments were made b/c of the NSF cheque and b/c Mr. Katsabanis had explained the financial difficulties to Hapco
?	The trustee submits Hapco then deceptively offered to supply further goods if the invoices were paid, but had actually no intention of doing so, adding that such trade practices should not be sanctioned by the Court, b/c it allow a creditor to make a promise it does not intend to fulfill in order to escape the principle of equal distribution among creditors
?	Mr. Katsabanis’ expectations were founded on the hope that Hapco would fulfill its orders ? Find this hope unreasonable given that he had jus told Hapco of Canadawide’s financial difficulties and that it was too tempting for Hapco, which was not a major supplier of Canadawide and which did not depend on its business, far form it, to say whatever it had to in order to secure immediate payment
?	In short, Mr. Katsabanis’ expectation that this payment would help Canadawide stay in business was unreasonable
-	The judge also held that the payments were not made outside the normal course of Canadawide’s business, given the circumstances 
?	The trustee answers that Canadawide’s “ordinary course of business” must be judged obecjtively, not subjectively
?	A company experiencing financial difficulty, running under the supervision of a consultant appointed by its bank, systematically preferring certain creditors over others and delaying payment is not operating in the ordinary course of its business
?	It would be a bad precedent, claims the trustee, for the Court to conclude that an extraordinary course of business carried out by an insolvent debtor, making desperate moves to avoid bankruptcy, is an ordinary course of business for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act
?	Creditors who were preferred, due to this extraordinary means of carrying on business, should not be able to justify the payments in question by the arguments that they were made in the ordinary course of business 
-	Agree w/ the trustee ? See nothing “ordinary” about Canadawide’s operations at the time the payments were made 
?	TJ focuses on the fact that the payment terms of 45 days for the first invoice and of 65 days for the second were not abnormal under the circumstances 
?	Find these considerations irrelevant given the more general context, namely that Canadawide had implemented a policy of paying only certain creditors under certain conditions

Logistec Stevedoring (Atlantic) Inc v AC Poirier & Associates Inc.
Held:
-	The TJ erred and failed to ask whether the impugned payment was made w/ the “dominant intent” of preferring one creditor over others
-	When that test is applied to the facts of the present case, it is evident that the debtor harboured no such intent
-	Admittedly, the creditor in receipt of the payment received a “preference in fact,” but that is not a sufficient basis for declaring the payment a fraudulent preference
-	S.95 has no application in circumstances where the insolvent debtor is effecting a payment w/ a view to generating income to be applied against the debts of both secured and unsecured creditors ? This remains true even if it were unrealistic to expect that the unsecured creditors would share in the income generated

Analysis:
-	The law is settled w/ respect to the interpretation and application of s.95 of the BIA
-	In order for a payment to a creditor to qualify as a fraudulent preference three conditions precedent must be met:
?	1) The payment must have been made within 3 months of bankruptcy;
?	2) The debtor must have been insolvent at the date of the payment; and 
?	3) As a result of the payment the creditor must have in fact received a preference over other creditors
-	Once the three conditions precedent have been met, a presumption arises that the payment was made “with a view to giving that creditor a preference over the other creditors” ? However, it is a rebuttable presumption
?	In that regard, the courts have interpreted the above-quoted phrase as placing an onus on the creditor to establish that the debtor’s dominant intent was not to prefer that creditor
?	The genesis of the dominant intent test is invariably traced to the following passage in Re Van de Liek:
?	When the trustee has proved these three essentials, he need proceed no further and the onus is then on the creditor to satisfy the courts, if he can, that there was no intent on the part of the debtor to give a performance
?	If the creditor can show on the balance of probabilities that the dominant intent of the debtor was not to prefer the creditor but was some other purpose, then the application will be dismissed, but if the creditor fails to meet the onus, then the trustee succeeds
-	Certain factors may or may not be relevant to the task of ascertaining the debtor’s dominant intent:
?	Based on the SC’s decision in Hudson v Benallack, it is settled law that the creditor’s knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time of the payment is an irrelevant consideration ? On the other hand, it is relevant that the corporate debtor knew of its insolvency at the date of the payment 
?	If the debtor is related to the creditor the payment will be scrutinized w/ greater care and suspicion
?	However, it is not defence to an allegation of fraudulent preference that the creditor exerted pressure on the insolvent debtor to secure the paying ? According to s.95(2), pressure is no longer a ground for upholding a transaction which is otherwise preferential within the meaning of s.95(1)
?	Finally, as the dominant intent test is an objective one, we need not be concerned w/ the subjective intent of the insolvent debtor at the time of the payment ? The requisite intent will be drawn from all of the relevant circumstances, as opposed to the debtor’s personal rumination
-	A concise and accurate statement of the law as to the relationship b/w the concept of preference in fact and dominant intent is found in Re Norris:
?	What would render that preference in fact a fraudulent one under s.95 is the accompanying intent of the insolvent debtor who in the face of imminent bankruptcy is moved to prefer or favour, before losing control over his assets, a particular creditor over others who will have to wait for and accept as full payment their rateable share on distribution by the Trustee in the ensuing bankruptcy
?	It is called fraudulent b/c it prejudices other creditors who will receive proportionately less, or nothing at all, and upsets the fundamental scheme of the Act for equal sharing among creditors
?	That accompanying intent to favour one creditor over another is what makes a preference in fact a fraudulent preference and is referred to in the cases as the “dominant intent”
-	The mere establishment of a preference in fact does not lead to the conclusion that the payment qualifies as a fraudulent preference within the meaning of s.95 of the BIA ? What we are left w/ is a rebuttable presumption that the payment in question so qualifies
?	Logistec bore the onus of establishing that St. Anne Pulp’s dominant intent was not to prefer Logistec over the other creditors 
?	Regrettably, the application judge did not address that issue ? For this reason, the court must draw the necessary inference from the primary findings of fact, as found by the application judge
-	St. Anne Pulp’s dominant intent may be formulated in at least one of four ways:
?	First, it can be argued that it intended to bestow a preference on Logistec over the other creditors
?	Second, it can be argued that St. Anne Pulp made the payment in order to honour its contractual obligations to its customers who had purchased the pulp and, hence, to ensure that the goods were duly shipped
?	Third, it can be argued that St. Anne Pulp’s dominant intent was to generate income in the form of accounts receivable ? Moneys collected would be applied against amounts owing to creditors and in the order of priority established at law
?	Fourth, it can be argued that St. Anne Pulp’s dominant intent was to maximize St. Anne Industries’ recovery on its secured debt ? This characterization is a logical extension of the reality that, as the primary secured creditor, St. Anne Industries is entitled to the proceeds arising from the sale of inventory in priority to the unsecured creditors 
-	If it can be fairly said that St. Anne Pulp’s dominant intent falls within either the second, third or fourth formulations, it is my view that the payment in question does not qualify as a fraudulent preference under s.95 of the BIA ? I so find
-	At common law and even after passage of the Statute of Elizabeth in 1570 there was no impediment against an insolvent debtor preferring one creditor over another ? The Q of why a debtor would prefer one creditor over another goes to the Q of the debtor’s underlying motive, which text writers point out is irrelevant to the issue of dominant intent
?	Admittedly, it is easy to blur the legal distinctions often drawn b/w motive, intent, purpose or object
?	Be that as it may, one cannot help but ask why a debtor would prefer one creditor over another 
?	In some cases the answer is self-evident ? The common law allowed an insolvent debtor to engage in selective generosity by paying first those he liked most; thus, payment to a creditor who is a family member or friend is more apt than not to qualify as a fraudulent preference within the meaning of s.95 of the BIA
?	Ironically, there is also a reported case in which the debtor allegedly made the payment to a non-related creditor in order to prefer a creditor who was a close but distant relative 
?	But even if there is no close relationship b/w the debtor and the preferred creditor, the payment may be caught by s.95
-	As a general observation, it is evident that the cases in which the creditor has been unable to rebut the presumption arising under s.95 of the BIA generally involve 2 factual patterns:
?	First, the insolvent debtor and the creditor in receipt of the payment are somehow related 
?	Second, the payment to an arm’s length creditor has the subsidiary effect of conferring an unjustified benefit or advantage on the insolvent debtor or a family member 
-	While these factual patterns are not exhaustive, it is clear that the facts of the present case do not support a finding that St. Anne Pulp’s dominant interest was to prefer Logistec over the other creditors ? But that is not the end of the matter; It is still necessary to isolate, by inference, St. Anne Pulp’s dominant intent
-	In my view, its ultimate goal was to generate income from its accounts receivable, the proceeds of which would be applied first against the debt owing to St. Anne Industries, the primary secured creditor ? In brief, St. Anne Pulp’s dominant intent was to maximize the amount that the receiver would recover on behalf of St. Anne Industries from the sale of the existing inventory
-	Does this inference support the allegation of fraudulent preference under s.95 of the BIA? ? It does not for two reasons:
?	First, s.95 speaks of fraudulent preference in terms of the creditor who received the payment ? In this case, it was Logistec who received the payment
?	Second, and more importantly, St. Anne Industries cannot be accused of obtaining a fraudulent preference when as a matter of law it is entitled to a preference as a secured creditor of St. Anne Pulp ? It is St. Anne Industries that has priority over the unsecured creditors by virtue of its security agreement
?	St. Anne Industries is to be paid first
?	If the income generated resulted in a surplus that surplus would be shared pro-rata amongst the unsecured creditors
?	The fact that St. Anne Pulp made the impugned payment to Logistec w/ a view to generating income which would be applied first against the debt owing to the secured creditor, St. Anne Industries, and then against amounts owing to the unsecured creditors, cannot be regarded as a valid basis on which to declare the payment to Logistec a fraudulent preference
-	My understanding of the law is that in circumstances where an insolvent debtor pays one creditor at the expense of another for purposes of carrying on business, the payment will more likely than not be deemed not to constitute a fraudulent preference within the meaning of s.95 of the BIA
-	Under Canadian law, if a creditor refuses to perform an act for an insolvent debtor, such as delivering goods or preparing income tax returns, unless its existing account is paid in full or in part, and the account is so paid in order to have the act performed, the transaction will not be deemed a fraudulent preference ? This is b/c the debtor made the payment, not for purposes of preferring the creditor, but rather to obtain the performance of an act which is consistent w/ what is expected of someone who is acting in the ordinary course of business
-	Admit that in the present case St. Anne Pulp did not make the payment for purposes of carrying on its pulp business in the long term 
?	The truth of the matter is that St. Anne Pulp was acting in the best interests of all concerned when it made the payment to Logistec
?	It would have been irresponsible for either St. Anne Pulp, the trustee or the privately appointed receiver to allow the inventory of pulp to sit in Logistec’s warehouse 
?	St. Anne Pulp had entered into binding contract for the sale of this product
?	The goods had to been shipped, otherwise St. Anne Pulp would have been in breach of its contractual obligations and liable for any consequential damages
?	When completed, those contracts generated income for St. Anne Pulp
-	What the trustee fails to appreciate is that although a debtor is insolvent, it is entitled to carry on in the ordinary course of business even if only for a day, so long as it is acting in a commercially reasonable manner and, therefore, in the best interests of all concerned
-	As well, the trustee appears to be proceeding on the mistake assumption that prior to the voluntary assignment in bankruptcy any moneys held in St. Anne Pulp’s bank account could be used only for purposes of effecting a settlement of all debts on a pro-rata basis ? The reality is that if anyone possessed a priority w/ respect to moneys in St. Anne Pulp’s bank account, it was St. Anne Industries under its general security agreement
?	That security extended not only to St. Anne Pulp’s accounts receivable and inventory, but also to all moneys held on St. Anne Pulp’s account 
?	It is out of that bank account that the receiver paid Logistec in order to secure shipment of the pulp
?	Had St. Anne Pulp not made the payment, here is what would have happened: On the following day, the newly appointed receiver would have seized the moneys held in St. Anne Pulp’s bank account ? From that account the receiver would have paid the full amount owing to Logistec, for both past and present work
?	As it happens, the fact that a substantial payment was made one day prior to the bankruptcy is of no moment
?	Finally, I should point out that the payment to Logistec will work to the benefit of the unsecured creditors in the event St. Anne Industries’ security agreement is successfully challenged and declared invalid 
?	The income generated by that payment would become available to all secured creditors
-	The fact that the payment was made one day prior to the voluntary assignment in bankruptcy, and that both Logistec and St. Anne Pulp were aware of the latter’s insolvency, threw suspicion over the transaction
-	However, when properly viewed, the transaction made good commercial sense ? There is no doubt that St. Anne Industries was the true beneficiary of St. Anne Pulp’s payment to Logistec
-	But no one can complain of the preferential treatment being accorded that secured creditor
-	The preference arises as a matter of the security contract and is sanctioned by both the common law and the BIA

Re Norris (QB)
Facts:
-	On November 25, 1992 Revenue Canada received a payment on taxes of $8,548.40 from David Carl Norris
-	On January 26, 1993 Mr. Norris made a voluntary assignment into bankruptcy
-	Revenue Canada had made a series of demands on the bankrupt

Analysis:
-	There is no serious dispute that the prima facie presumption under s. 95 as raised by the Trustee had established the three required criteria, namely:
?	That the transfer took place within three months of bankruptcy;
?	That at the date the transfer was made, it gave the creditor a preference in fact;
?	That the debtor was an insolvent person at the date of the payment
-	Section 95(2) of the Act provides that the presumption may be rebutted on a balance of probabilities that the dominant intention of the debtor was not to prefer the creditor
-	There were only two issues that Revenue Canada could use to rebut the presumption:
?	They were a diligent creditor
?	Alternatively, the payment was made in the ordinary course of business

Ordinary Course of Business:
-	I have accepted the submission of counsel for the Trustee
-	As stated in its brief of law, all of the cases cited by Revenue Canada can fairly be characterized as payments made by the debtor in the ordinary course of its business to trade creditors for two reasons: Firstly, so that the bankrupt might take advantage of favourable payment terms or, secondly, to secure a continued supply of goods and services from those trade creditors in order that it might continue in its business
-	There is no doubt that evidence that after payment on account, goods were supplied to the bankrupt by a trade creditor which, under normal circumstances, rebut the presumption
-	I accept Mr. Rowan's submission that Revenue Canada was not a trade creditor and there was no evidence that would assist Revenue Canada to be considered a trade creditor in having received a payment in the ordinary course of business

Diligent Creditor:
-	The case of Re Houston and Thornton followed by Coopers & Lybrand Limited v. O'Brien Electric Co. Ltd is cited for the following proposition:
?	"Both creditors had substantially overdue accounts and both were exerting every effort to obtain payment of their accounts. As has been so often said, our law does not penalize a diligent creditor. In order for me to set aside these transactions, I must find there was a fraudulent scheme on the part of the debtor to prefer these creditors over other creditors.
?	On the evidence, I cannot find any such scheme. Rather, I think it is a situation where diligent creditors have managed to obtain substantial payments on their accounts at a time when other creditors, who were not as diligent, did not obtain payment...
?	The only reason for making the payments to the respondents was because the respondents were pressing more vigorously than other creditors for payment of their accounts."
-	I have again accepted the submissions of counsel for the Trustee that these authorities are characterized by a theme of an extremely aggressive creditor whose actions would cause an imminent business crisis unless they were dealt with. As Mr. Rowan stated:
?	"The payments were motivated by a desire to 'get the creditor off the debtor's back', and because the continued actions of the creditor would cause an immediate business crisis"
-	Frankly, in my view, the forwarding of three letters, one of which threatened legal action and the subsequent granting of one month's grace period, could best be described as steps that any ordinary creditor would take, making demands and threatening legal proceedings
-	I accept the proposition that the actions of Revenue Canada, when compared with those in the cited authorities, did not amount to such aggressive action such as to create an imminent business or personal crisis for the bankrupt
-	Had Revenue Canada in fact taken garnishee proceedings or instructed seizure, I should have held otherwise
-	Accordingly, as the presumed intention was not, in my view, rebutted on the balance of probabilities, I ordered that Revenue Canada pay the Trustee the sum of $8,546.40

Re Norris (CA)
-	By amendment to the Bankruptcy & Insolvency Act effective November 30, 1992, the traditional priority of the Crown theretofore enjoyed at common law for its claims for income tax owed by a bankrupt are removed ? In bankruptcies occurring after that date, proven Crown claims are to rank equally and be paid rateably with all other unsecured creditors
-	The issue in this appeal is whether a payment of income tax to the Minister of National Revenue made within the three months preceding the taxpayer's bankruptcy was a fraudulent preference within the meaning of s. 95 of the Bankruptcy & Insolvency Act and void as against the Trustee
-	In his written reasons, the learned justice said: … There is no serious dispute that the prima facie presumption under s. 95 as raised by the Trustee had established the three required criteria ? This is manifest error: the presumption under s. 95 does not establish the three required criteria but rather it is the proof of the three criteria which raises the presumption
-	 No suggestion is made that the learned judge misunderstood the test in s. 95
?	The error obviously results from an inadvertent clerical transposition of thoughts or words, or from an accidental omission of part of his text, missed in proofreading before issue
?	This editorial error was not commented on by counsel at the hearing, and I would not have raised it but for the fact that the reasons are now reported and that this test case may go higher
-	There is no disagreement between the parties as to the substance and effect of s. 95 of the Act ? It creates and defines the concept of fraudulent preference as it applies in bankruptcy
?	It sets out the three elements which had to be proven by the Trustee in its application to set aside the payment as a fraudulent preference, namely, (1) that the payment in question was made to an ordinary creditor within three months of the bankruptcy; (2) that the bankrupt was at the date the payment was made an insolvent person within one of the definitions in s. 2 and; (3) that the payment was made by the debtor "with a view to giving that creditor a preference over the other creditors," in the words of the statute
?	If elements (1) and (2) are established and the Trustee proves that the creditor received a preference in fact over other creditors, s. 95(2) then raises a presumption in the absence of evidence to the contrary that the preference in fact was made with a view to giving that creditor a preference over the other creditors, and was thus a fraudulent preference within s. 95(1)
?	The presumption is rebuttable and will be rebutted if the totality of the evidence to the contrary at the end of the case is sufficient to show on the balance of probabilities that the debtor did not have the dominant intent to prefer the creditor over others when he made the impeached payment
-	In considering this section, it is well to keep in mind the distinction between preference in fact and fraudulent preference as that latter is defined in the Act
?	There can be no doubt in this case that Revenue Canada received a preference in fact from the payment of tax made by this debtor on November 25, 1992 ? Its debt was paid where the debts owing to other ordinary creditors were not
?	What would render that preference in fact a fraudulent one under s. 95 is the accompanying intent of the insolvent debtor who in the face of imminent bankruptcy is moved to prefer or favour, before losing control over his assets, a particular creditor over others who will have to wait for and accept as full payment their rateable share on distribution by the Trustee in the ensuing bankruptcy
?	It is called fraudulent because it prejudices other creditors who will receive proportionately less, or nothing at all, and upsets the fundamental scheme of the Act for equal sharing among creditors ? That accompanying intent to favour one creditor over another is what makes a preference in fact a fraudulent preference and is referred to in the cases as the "dominant intent"
?	The state of mind of the debtor at the time of making the payment is ultimately the paramount consideration to be addressed by the court ? The intent or state of mind of the preferred creditor is irrelevant (Hudson v. Benallack)
-	This concept of "dominant intent" of the debtor comes to us from English law
-	It is irrelevant under American law where preference in fact is sufficient for setting aside a preferential payment if other preconditions set out in that bankruptcy code are met
-	Why a department of government charged to administer legislation and compelled by the rules of natural justice to act fairly and impartially, and unable to return a quid pro quo favour would ever be intentionally so favoured by an insolvent debtor over other creditors is difficult to understand. It is possible, but seems highly improbable at first blush. The allegation of it and its prima facie occurrence invItes a close scrutiny of all surrounding circumstances for another and more likely purpose behind the preference in fact, particularly where the bankruptcy is not sought by creditors but is voluntary and its timing orchestrated by the debtor himself.
19     If after consideration of all of the evidence before it the court is satisfied on a balance of probability that the debtor was pursuing a purpose other than that of favouring the particular creditor over others, the presumption is displaced and the application fails. The finding of the court on that particular issue is one of fact which will not be disturbed on appeal, unless relevant evidence has not been taken into account by the trier of fact. This unfortunately is the situation in this appeal; two items of cogent evidence on the specific issue of dominant intent found in the material filed by the Trustee in support of its application were not brought to our attention at the hearing before us, and presumably not brought to the attention of the learned chambers judge at his hearing.
20     The first item of cogent evidence, not disclosed, was that of a family relationship existing between the creditor Carl Ortan Norris and the bankrupt. This issue was first raised by the court in a question to counsel for the Trustee because of the similarity in names, and counsel for the Trustee advised the court that there was no evidence of such relationship. He asserted to the court that as far as he knew the similarity in names was a mere coincidence. This was accepted by the court and the issue not then pursued further. Judgment was then reserved and the court recessed. When reviewing the material thereafter, in preparation for judgment, the court itself discovered that, contrary to what counsel for the Trustee had stated to it, there was indeed in the Trustee's own material a statement by the creditor Carol Ortan Norris that he was related to the debtor. That evidence was in his Proof of Claim for $15,000.00 filed with the Trustee's material. This positive assertion had been achieved by crossing out the word "not" appearing before the word "related" in the printed form. This alteration of the form seems to have escaped the attention of counsel for the Trustee as weld as counsel for the appellant.
21     This was relevant to the issue of dominant intent. Just as preference given to a close relative can support an inference of a dominant intent to prefer that relative over others, so a preference given to an unrelated creditor which would materially adversely affect the claim of a close relative could support an inference against a dominant intent to prefer the unrelated creditor to the related one.
22     The other relevant evidence not drawn to the attention of the learned chambers judge, nor to us, is found in the Statement of Affairs signed by the bankrupt in support of his assignment into bankruptcy. To Question 9, appendix B: "within the last 12 months have you disposed of or transferred any of your assets," the answer is "No". To-question 10A: "within the last 5 years have you sold, disposed of or transferred any real estate," the answer is "Yes". The explanatory note to question 10A reads that in August, 1992, he sold real estate property in Calgary for $179,000.00, and adds "net proceeds used as a down payment on another residence." No further details are given. Then in the statement of assets, under item 6 "real property" in form 74A is stated: "House ... NE 24-69-12-W6 (joint) (Enc) (exempt) ... 75,000.00." The Statement of Affairs further discloses that the bankrupt was self-employed as a 50 per cent shareholder in a construction business which ceased to operate on September 1, 1992, and that he was unemployed at the date of the statement. The timing of the voluntary assignment and the orchestration of the events leading to the claimed expenditure remained throughout with the bankrupt. These were factual circumstances surrounding the alleged preferential payment to Revenue Canada which were relevant to the issue of dominant intent and to the issue of "evidence to the contrary" under s. 95. The respondent Trustee in bankruptcy was duty bound but failed to draw to the attention of the Court these factual circumstances.
23     The duty of a Trustee in bankruptcy, as well as those of counsel, is referred to in Harper v. Harper [1980] 1 S.C.R. 2 in the context of an application to admit fresh evidence. Laskin C.J. speaking for the unanimous nine member Court on this point, said at p. 13:

1.	"It is clear that Justice Ritchie did not lay down an exhaustive test for the admissibility of fresh evidence in the Supreme Court, saying only what the special grounds under the proviso to s. 67 include. In my opinion, they also include a situation where there has been a failure of an officer of the Court, e.g. a trustee in bankruptcy, to bring all the relevant matters to the Court's attention, although the matters were not newly discovered but existed before trial: see Brown v. Gentleman. Equally, in my opinion, they will yield to a situation where a solicitor as an officer of the Court has not brought to the Court's attention pre-existing matters of which he had knowledge or where a party to the proceedings has misled the Court as to facts in issue or has misled his own solicitor or counsel, with the result that the action has proceeded on an erroneous factual basis."

1.	and at p. 16

1.	"... No Court can condone attempts to mislead it; and if the respondent put his counsel, be he Mr. Scoffield or Mr. Horn, in an unenviable position, the Court is entitled to have their co-operation in clarifying the record once they have become aware of the true state of the title.

1.	At the conclusion of the hearing of the motion for leave to adduce new evidence, the Court was unanimously of the opinion that the motion should be granted, with costs of the motion to the successful appellant and with reasons to be delivered later. The reasons have been set out in what has gone before, and I turn now to the merits in the light of the newly admitted evidence."
24     The duties of a Trustee in bankruptcy are also outlined in brief form in Houlden & Morawetz and I quote from the 1995 annotated Bankruptcy & Insolvency page 32:

1.	"C. SS. 10 Duties and Powers of Trustees - Generally

1.	The Trustee is an officer of the court and should impartially represent the interest of creditors: Re Roy (1963), 4 C.B.R. (N.S.) 275 (Que. S.C.). He should act equitably and, as far as possible, hold an even hand between competing interests of various classes of creditors: Re Reed (1980), 34 C.B.R. (N.S.) 83 (Ont. C.A.). In bringing proceedings, such as an application to set aside a fraudulent preference, he should not adopt an adversarial or hostile role: Touche Ross Ltd. v. Weldwood of Canada Sales Ltd. (1983), 48 C.B.R. (N.S.) 83, additional reasons at 49 C.B.R. (N.S.) 284 Ont. S.C.). Rather, he should present the relevant facts to the court in a dispassionate, non-adversarial manner, and leave the matter to the court for decision.

1.	The trustee is under a continuing duty, until his discharge, to effect recovery of the assets of the bankrupt, and the fact that the bankrupt has received his discharge in no way affects that duty: Re Salloum (1988), 69 C.B.R. (N.S.) 255, 22 B.C.L.R. (2d) 77 (S.C.)."
The Trustee in this case adopted an adversarial and hostile role in this application. Instead of presenting to the court, as it was his duty to do as an officer of the court, all the relevant facts which were within his knowledge as Trustee, he presented a bare bones skeletal case just sufficient to invoke the presumption in s. 95(2) without disclosing to the court those facts in his material to which I have already alluded which might, in the mind of the chambers judge, weigh against the presumption. This is conduct by a Trustee as an officer of the court which must not be tolerated or condoned. A judge is entitled to expect that all relevant and pertinent information on any application placed before him by officers of the court will be specifically drawn to his attention even if it is also in the written material. This was not followed here. Accordingly, the decision of the chambers judge cannot stand.
25     This is a proper case for adopting what was suggested by Huband J.A. of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in the case of Craig (Trustee of) v. Craig (1989), 76 C.B.R. (N.S.) 256 at 261, 63 Man.R. (2d) 122, where he said:

1.	"When a motion for an order under s. 95 is contested and affidavit evidence is filed by a respondent, the normal practice will be to direct a trial of the issues so that the decision can be based upon viva voce evidence rather than affidavits and attached exhibits."
26     The two issues raised in this application whether the bankrupt was insolvent within s. 2 of the Act, and whether the presumption in s. 95, if it arose, was rebutted by evidence to the contrary, are referred back to the Court of Queen's Bench for trial.

Re Pacific Mobile Corporation (CA Que)
Appeal allowed.

Acceptance and deposit of a cheque has the effect of suspending the exer cise by the creditor of his recourse until payment or refusal of payment of the cheque by the drawer's bank.

Whether or not a payment is made in the ordinary course of business is a question which must be examined in accordance with the currently existing statutory dispositions. The criterion upon which the trial judge relied to the effect that a payment cannot have been made in the ordinary course of business if it was made after its due date, is by no means absolute. The term "ordinary course of business" refers to a transaction into which it would be usual for a creditor and debtor to enter as a matter of business in the circumstances of the particular case uninfluenced by any belief on the part of the creditor that the debtor might be insolvent. It does not require an investigation of the course pursued in any particular trade or vocation and does not refer to what is normal and usual in the specific business of the debtor or that of the creditor. The approach of the court must be objective, that is, the decisive consideration is not the attitude or opinion of the insolvent person or debtor but that of the ordinary man of business. A court must ask itself whether, if regarded objectively, solvent persons would, in the normal course of business, act in the same way as the parties concerned in the transaction. Alternatively, the transaction must be regarded in the light of the ordinary course of business, historically, between the specific parties. Accordingly, the notion of "ordinary course of business" is essentially an abstract one and the court's mission is to consider the specific circumstances of each case with a view to characterizing a specific transaction. This involves the perpetual interaction between law and fact. The least that can be said is that it is incorrect that a payment which is not made on its due date cannot have been made in the ordinary course of business.

Re Pacific Mobile Corporation (SCC)
Facts:
The trustee sought to recover from the respondent creditor a payment to it with respect to an account which was overdue at the time payment was received. The payment was made within the three-month statutory period. At trial the trustee obtained an order annulling the payment as constituting fraudulent preference. The Court of Appeal (Lajoie J.A. dissenting) reversed the trial judgment. The trustee appealed.

Ratio:
In order to determine whether a certain transaction takes place in the "ordinary course of business", it is best to consider the circumstances of each case and to take into account the type of business carried on by the debtor and creditor. In this case the late payment made was not only normal in the context of the business relationship of the parties but was also standard for the particular industry.

Analysis:
This appeal raises two narrow questions in the area of bankruptcy law. First, what is meant by the term "ordinary course of business" in the context of s. 73 of the Bankruptcy Act R.S.C. 1970, c. B-3. Second, was the overdue payment in this case made in the "ordinary course of business".
2      We are all of the view, for the reasons set out by Monet J.A. of the Quebec Court of Appeal [44 C.B.R. (N.S.) 190, 141 D.L.R. (3d) 696, reversing 34 C.B.R. (N.S.) 8], that this appeal must fail.
3      It is not wise to attempt to give a comprehensive definition of the term "ordinary course of business" for all transactions. Rather, it is best to consider the circumstances of each case and to take into account the type of business carried on between the debtor and creditor.
4      We approve of the following passage from Monet J.A.'s reasons discussing the phrase "ordinary course of business" at p. 205:
Il ressort de ces autorités, me semble-t-il, que, d'une part, la notion qui nous concerne est une notion abstraite et que, d'autre part, les tribunaux ont pour mission d'apprécier les circonstances propres à chaque espèce afin de déterminer la qualification d'une transaction donnée. C'est, en somme, le va-et-vient perpétuel entre le droit et le fait. Mais, avec égards, je crois qu'on ne peut pas affirmer qu'un paiement qui n'est pas fait à échéance ne peut être considéré comme ayant été fait dans le cours ordinaire des affaires.
5      In this case, it is clear, based on the evidence adduced, that the payment was made in the ordinary course of business. The late payment by Pacific Mobile to American Biltrite was not only normal in the context of their business relationship, but was also standard for their particular industry.
6      In his factum, as well as in oral argument, the appellant relied upon this court's decision in Hudson v. Benallack, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 168, 21 C.B.R. (N.S.) 111, [1975] 6 W.W.R. 109, 59 D.L.R. (3d) 1, 7 N.R. 119, to interpret the term "ordinary course of business". He placed particular emphasis on the following passage at pp. 175-76:
The object of the bankruptcy law is to ensure the division of the property of the debtor rateably among all his creditors in the event of his bankruptcy. Section 112 of the Act provides that, subject to the Act, all claims proved in the bankruptcy shall be paid pari passu. The Act is intended to put all creditors upon an equal footing. Generally, until a debtor is insolvent or has an act of bankruptcy in contemplation, he is quite free to deal with his property as he wills and he may prefer one creditor over another but, upon becoming insolvent, he can no longer do any act out of the ordinary course of business which has the effect of preferring a particular creditor over other creditors. If one creditor receives a preference over other creditors as a result of the debtor acting intentionally and in fraud of the law, this defeats the equality of the bankruptcy laws.
7      In our view, the appellant has incorrectly interpreted the above passage. Hudson, dealt with one point only: whether the words "with a view to giving such creditor a preference", contained in s. 73(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, require an intention on the part of the insolvent debtor alone to prefer or a concurrent intent on the part of both the debtor and creditor. The court held that only the intention of the debtor was relevant. That case did not, in any way, consider or determine the meaning of the term "ordinary course of business" and is, therefore, not helpful in the resolution of the issues at hand.

Conclusion
8      For the reasons set out by Monet J.A. of the Quebec Court of Appeal, the payment made by Pacific Mobile to American Biltrite was a payment made in the "ordinary course of business". Therefore, the payment is not void as against the appellant under s. 73 of the Bankruptcy Act. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.

Re Ramsey
-	[16] Section 95 and it predecessors, or similar legislation in earlier insolvency litigation, has
-	probably spawned more litigation than any other section of the BIA. Each decision is based on
-	the evidence and the facts as they are found by the trier, and deference is to be extended to those
-	findings of fact. If there is evidence to support the ruling, or no evidence found that would raise
-	"special circumstances," (to use the Registrar's expression), the ruling below should be supported
-	unless it is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. In this case, I agree with the
-	decision of the Registrar.
-	[17] The Registrar speaks of "special circumstances" twice in his reasoning. That expression
-	does not come from the BIA. The statute directs that there is a presumption arising against the
-	validity of the payments. The payments are deemed fraudulent and void, and by subsection 2, are
-	"presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have been made, ...with a view to
-	giving the creditor a preference...etc."
-	[18] What is the meaning of evidence to the contrary in this context? In Re Norris the Court
-	of Appeal comments on this at ¶ 19:
-	If after consideration of all of the evidence before it the Court is satisfied on a balance of
-	probability (sic) that the debtor was pursuing a purpose other than that of favouring the
-	particular creditor over others, the presumption is displaced and the application fails.
-	[19] The court also commented on the influence of English cases on the subject. The English
-	law is different in its wording, and therefore in its application, but the principle is clear that the
-	search is for the debtor’s intention in making the payment. The early authorities hold that there
-	may be a preference in fact when the court does not find a "dominant intention" to prefer. In
-	those cases, the British courts often held that the payment was not fraudulent within the
-	meaning of the section that governed in that jurisdiction. Some guidance is to be found in those
-	cases.
-	[20] The addition of section 95(2) in the BIA removed "pressure" as a consideration, thus
-	providing greater guidance to Canadian practitioners than that found in the earlier statutes
-	construed in Great Britain. This section has also made evidence of pressure in support of the
-	transaction inadmissible. At the same time, the section also says that a preference could be found
-	even if it was made voluntarily.
-	[21] In this case, there is ample evidence that the Bankrupt was insolvent at the time of the
-	payments and that the payments were made to some creditors within the prohibited period. The
-	2006 ABQB 337 (CanLII)
-	Page: 8
-	search is for evidence to the contrary that is accepted and results in a finding on the balance of
-	probabilities that there was not an intention to prefer.
-	[22] The Bankrupt gave evidence of his motive. He said he wanted to pay off one of the two
-	credit card creditors because of the high interest rate charged by that bank. Nothing is said about
-	the other credit card issuer who was paid. The Bankrupt also testified in his affidavit and
-	examination that he cashed in one significant asset he owned, his RRSP account, to make the
-	payment. However, as the Registrar pointed out, the Bankrupt's credit was secure with those two
-	credit card lenders, he still had a clear line of credit, and he was not in default on the credit card
-	debts. However, he was in default with the CCRA.
-	[23] The Court has reviewed these sections on many occasions. The decision in Re Norris
-	drew my attention to the experience in Great Britain and the several English authorities that first
-	explored this matter of dominant intent, preference in fact, and fraudulent preference.
-	[24] Many of the early English cases that deal with this matter are cases where the doctrine of
-	pressure was considered. The English legislation did not have the prohibition that is contained in
-	s. 95 (2), which has been present in the BIA for many years.
-	[25] Re Norris, at page 221 of the CBR, cites s. 95(1) and (2), but the second subsection, as
-	quoted by the Court of Appeal, is missing the references to pressure. The phrase – “or under
-	pressure and evidence of pressure shall not be admissible” should appear between the words
-	“voluntarily” and “to support.” The quotation in Re Norris reads as follows:
-	"whether or not it was made voluntarily to support the transaction"
-	[26] The relevant amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1985 amend the Act to:
-	change the title to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (S.C. 1992, c. 27, s.1);
-	to clarify some of the language of s. 95 and to amend s. 95(3) (S.C. 1997. C. 12, s.
-	56); and
-	to "harmonize federal law with the civil law of the Province of Quebec and to
-	amend certain acts in order to ensure that each language version takes into
-	account the common law and the civil law" (Hansard, Volume 139, Number 054,
-	3rd Session, 37th Parliament, May 13, 2004).
-	None of these amendments removed the references to pressure from s. 95(2).
-	[26] My purpose in mentioning this difference is that many of the early English decisions
-	focussed on whether there was pressure, and the pressure was taken into account to determine
-	whether the transaction should be supported.
-	[27] In one of the earliest reported cases, Butcher v. Stead in the House of Lords in 1875, the
-	statute being interpreted was the Bankruptcy Act of 1869, which at that time contained an
-	exception for the protection of a creditor who was paid in good faith and for valuable
-	2006 ABQB 337 (CanLII)
-	Page: 9
-	consideration, without knowledge of any fraud or fraudulent intent. Thus, if a payment otherwise
-	considered fraudulent was made to such a creditor, it was held that the claim of preference could
-	not succeed. The case was decided on the construction of a saving clause unique to the
-	Bankruptcy statute under consideration. Law Journal (1875), New Series, Vol. XLIV
-	Michaelmas Term 1874 to Trinity Term (Bankruptcy) 1875 at p. 129.
-	[28] In 1899, the matter attracted the attention of the House of Lords in Sharp v. Jackson,
-	[1899] A.C. 419. There a trustee, who had committed breaches of trust and was insolvent,
-	conveyed an estate to make good the breaches of trust on the eve of his bankruptcy, without any
-	pressure or request by his cestui qui trust. The Court held that there was no fraudulent preference
-	within s. 48 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1883, because the debtor's intention was to shield himself
-	from the consequences of his breaches of trust.
-	[29] The Law Lords held that there had been no pressure by the creditor upon the trustee. No
-	demand had been made or pressure applied. His act was entirely voluntary and the analysis of
-	the facts led the House to conclude that the trustee did not have his creditors in mind at all, only
-	an object to protect himself from criminal and civil responsibility for his breaches of trust.
-	Further, there was no preference within the meaning of the section they were considering. The
-	Earl of Halsbury noted in his speech (at page 423), quoting from Lord Cairns in Butcher v.
-	Stead:
-	The Act (Bankruptcy) however, did not profess to express the existing law without
-	making considerable changes in it. In the case of fraudulent preference, for example, in
-	place of raising an inquiry whether it was done in contemplation of bankruptcy, the Act
-	provided certain definite tests, namely that the Bankrupt should have been at the time
-	unable to pay his debts, as they became due, from his own moneys, and that he should
-	become bankrupt within three months from the date of payment. The Act appears to have
-	left the question as it stood under the old law; and, indeed, the use of the work
-	‘preference,’ implying an act of free will, would, of itself, make it necessary to consider
-	whether pressure had or had not been used.
-	Lord Halsbury then goes on in his speech:
-	Nothing could have been easier than to have enacted, if they had thought proper to do so,
-	that any preference to one creditor over another creditor, or any greater advantage - I do
-	not want to use the word "preference," because questions may arise as to the true
-	construction of that word itself - but any advantage given by previous payment to one
-	creditor, to which advantage all the other creditors were not a party, should of itself be a
-	preference which should be void under the statute. Nothing, I say, could have been easier
-	than to have made such an enactment, if that was intended; but, in my opinion, no so such
-	intention is to be gathered from the statute.
-	[30] All the Law Lords held that the issue of pressure was left out of the statute and left the
-	law as it had always been. The inquiry was the dominant or real motive of the person making the
-	2006 ABQB 337 (CanLII)
-	Page: 10
-	payment. They found that the dominant or real motive leading to granting the deed was that the
-	Bankrupt intended to protect himself from claims of breach of trust and possible criminal
-	sanction, and not to prefer. Of course, the evidence made it clear to the Law Lords just what
-	personal pressure the Bankruptcy was facing. Evidence of that pressure was before them. It
-	would not be admitted under the current Canadian regime.
-	[31] It will be seen how closely the present section in the BIA follows the earlier English
-	drafting. The substantial difference, I find, and the matter that takes the Canadian jurisprudence
-	out of the old cases on the subject, such as Butcher v. Stead, is the second subsection. That
-	subsection has two primary effects: it removes absolutely from consideration any evidence of
-	pressure, and it makes clear, in the manner suggested in the speech of Lord Halsbury might have
-	been done by the drafters of the statute he was considering, the over-riding presumption in
-	favour of preference, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. This is so, as the Canadian
-	statute makes clear, "whether or not it was made voluntarily or under pressure and evidence of
-	pressure shall not be admissible to support the transaction".
-	[32] So, in this case, once the legislated prerequisites of:
o	payment made to creditor,
o	within three months of the Bankruptcy,
o	that gives any creditor a preference over other creditors,
o	when the debtor was insolvent,
-	there is a presumption of preference, even if the payment was not made voluntarily or was made
-	under pressure. Further, evidence of pressure is not admissible to support the transaction.
-	[33] The old cases and the Digests (Halsbury, Laws of England, 1908, Vol 2, Bankruptcy
-	and Insolvency, page 284 ff) show that pressure played a large part in earlier decisions. If such
-	pressure was proved to exist, it is of no importance that there was also present to the debtor's
-	mind a desire to prefer. It is noted that although pressure by the creditor, real and operative, is
-	conclusive in favour of the validity of the transaction, still it is not necessary to prove pressure if
-	there are other circumstances which suffice to rebut the presumption of fraudulent intention and
-	to show that the act complained of was not done with the dominant view to prefer.
-	[34] In those cases, if there was pressure real and operative, it was conclusive in favour of the
-	validity of the transaction. Is it not likely the case that if the House of Lords had been
-	considering the situation involving a statute the same as the present section in the BIA, that they
-	would have come to a different conclusion? I think so.
-	[35] The present Canadian legislation has quite reversed the matter. Because the second
-	subsection presumes that if all the other matters have been established, the payment is fraudulent
-	in the absence of evidence to the contrary. The learned Registrar made that point when
-	considering the evidence before him, searching, as he says for the "dominant intent" of the
-	payor, the Bankrupt. This language is taken from the old law and the old cases. Those cases were
-	2006 ABQB 337 (CanLII)
-	Page: 11
-	decided in a regime in which the onus was on the Trustee. See, for example, In Re Laurie 67 L.J.
-	(Q.B.) 431, and Peat v. Gresham Trust, Limited, [1934] A.C. 252. In my opinion, the present
-	wording of s.95(2) places the onus on the Bankrupt to introduce some compelling evidence that
-	allows the Court to override the presumption. The Registrar did that. He spoke of the evidence
-	relating to Ramsey's motive, and he found it did not amount to evidence to the contrary. There
-	was no evidence that established, on the balance of probabilities, an innocent intent.
-	[36] In the last mentioned case Lord Tomlin’s words may leave the impression that, where
-	there is no direct evidence of an intention to prefer and there is room for more than one
-	explanation, it is not enough to say that the intent to prefer must be inferred. From those words it
-	was argued that, if there are two reasonable inferences from the evidence, one of which is
-	favourable to the debtor, then the onus of proving a fraudulent preference has not been
-	discharged. In Re Kushler, Ltd., [1943] All E.R. 22, the editorial note, at page 23, makes the
-	point that this would place a heavier burden on the trustee seeking to prove a fraudulent
-	preference than is placed upon a person in an ordinary case who has to prove intent.
-	[37] Here it is decided that the law is the same in the case of a fraudulent preference as in any
-	other case where intent must be proved. If the Court is left in any reasonable doubt, the onus has
-	not been discharged, but, while the Court will be slow to draw an inference which involves a
-	taint something approaching dishonesty, it will be guided by the probabilities and, given solid
-	ground for drawing the inference it will draw it although there may be some possible innocent
-	inference from the facts proved. And this comment must be taken as well in the light of the
-	Canadian legislation which places the onus not on the trustee but on the creditor. In Re Van der
-	Liek, [1970] O.J. No. 1053, 14 C.B.R. (NS) 229 (Ont. H.C.J.) at 231, applied in Re S, (1975), 56
-	DLR (3rd) 578, 21 C.B.R. (N.S.) 10 (BCSC).
-	[38] Indeed, there is authority in Great Britain that if the payment is made to a creditor
-	because that creditor charges a higher rate of interest, that is enough to establish the intent to
-	prefer. See Ex parte Hill, 23 Ch.D 695.
-	[39] The old statute in England spoke of a "deem[ing] the preference to be fraudulent". Our
-	current legislation speaks of a mandatory presumption that it is a fraudulent preference in the
-	absence of evidence to the contrary. The cases cited in Halsbury at p 284 under "Other
-	Circumstances" list a number of such ‘other circumstances". There is no evidence in this case
-	that falls into any of those categories, and indeed, the only evidence of the motive or the intent of
-	the Bankrupt is recited by the Registrar, who notes that this evidence amounts only to
-	explanations of thought processes and ruminations about ordering his affairs, without amounting
-	to evidence to the contrary.
-	[40] In my opinion, the Registrar's reasons withstand criticism. There is evidence to support
-	the conclusions arrived at, an absence of evidence to the contrary, and applying the principles of
-	s. 95, the Appellants have not rebutted the presumption. Deference should be accorded to the
-	Registrar’s findings on the evidence; moreover, the ruling is reasonable

-	2.5 hours most likely / 100% exam
-	Re Norris ? Defence failed b/c creditor not found to have acted aggressively enough
?	Contrary to statute, creditor’s diligence can rebut the presumption that there was a preference
?	Shows that debtor didn’t intend 
?	If creditor’s aggressive enough, shows that debtor didn’t have a choice ? So how can it be that debtor preferred ad creditor and at the same time, the debtor didn’t have a choice
?	We still have this method contrary to statute
?	“Cause an imminent business crisis w/ the debtor” ? Extremely aggressive creditor and in Re Norris, the creditor was not aggressive enough
?	This defence has a really wide scope ? So when we have a test like this, there is very broad scope of trying to establish what creditor diligence would be in order to rebut a presumption
-	In Canada we have a debtor deterrence rationale
-	The section makes debtor culpability the focal point 
-	The Creditor diligence defence undermines the rule that evidence of pressure is inadmissible ? Alternative approach: Limits creditor diligence exception to cases of extreme aggression
?	The problem is that the whole premise of that is to award $ to super aggressive creditors
?	This is what bankruptcy law is trying to prevent
-	Undermines the statutory rule that abolishes the doctrine of pressure
-	Undermines purpose of bankruptcy stays
-	In Re Norris, wasn’t overturned b/c of pressure ? Fraudulent b/c you are defrauding creditors b/c you’re paying one creditor over another
-	Good case for showing what we’re looking for under this section: 1) How presumption arises; 2) How presumption rebutted; 3) Doctrine of pressure defence 

2007 Amendments
-	Non-arm’s length transactions ? “That the effect of giving that creditor a preference”
?	Intention of debtor/creditor is irrelevant
?	Underlying policy goal: Equality
-	The more courts infer intention from surrounding circumstances, the more you move to a regime with strict liability
-	Creditor diligence is not admissible ? But this has been allowed by courts on the contrary
?	The scope of the defence is, again, completely uncertain
?	1) Supports creditor-deterrence rationale; 2) Defence is available depending on the creditor’s level of aggression (which is kind of perverse)
-	Another problem is that the statute is indeterminate ? Courts exercise discretion in an inconsistent way
-	Another problem is that s.95 is not a complete code ? Provincial law still applies (may undermine policies in the statute)
?	When you have the application of provincial law, w/ federal statute, how provincial law is implied and interpreted n different provinces, you have a possibility of non-uniform cases; we should must much uniformity as possible
-	These amendments were brought into this section to make things easier
-	BUT the thing is that if the policy was to facilitate preference recovery, the one that makes most sense is a strict liability regime ? E.g. If you have this debtor deterrence rationale underlying statute and you look for debtor intention, but in fact, you’re not looking for debtor intention but circumstances that refer to debater intention, why not go to a strict liability regime? 
?	It is the more reasonable response to move to a strict liability regime w/ no deference if this is what you’re really trying to accomplish under this revision
-	Anytime you have a case-by-case basis (ordinary course of business, which is primarily factual to determine whether it’s been met) is going to cause a lot of litigation 
-	The point of these provisions is to prevent litigation 

Difference b/w Prov and BIA
-	Proof of intent

Crown Claims
-	The Q is: Where should the Crown rank in the distribution scheme?
-	Historically, you always had the Crown trying to grant itself a favoured creditor status

Traditional justifications for Crown priority 
-	Tax claims are different ? “A debt owing to the crown is a debt owing to the public at large …”
-	Taxing authorities are involuntary creditors
-	Debtor sometimes acts as tax collectors for the gov’t ** 
-	Potential discouragement of taxing authorities

Critics Respond
-	Loss to community v loss to private creditors ** Loss insignificant to gov’t in comparison to the same loss to a private creditor
-	Gov’t has enhanced mechanisms to collect
-	Gov’t has access to better information re debtor

Protecting the Crown:
-	What we are concerned w/ is two time periods:
-	How do we protect the Crown before bankruptcy and how do we protect the Crown once bankruptcy occurs
?	Pre-bankruptcy ? How does crown attempt to protect its interests outside bankruptcy?
?	Bankruptcy ? What happens to crown claims? And what claims will be recognized as having priority within the context of a bankruptcy distribution scheme?
-	Outside of bankruptcy, the effectiveness of the crown’s claim is going to depend on provincial/federal statutes
?	Statute itself may grant the Crown a charge (lien, security interest over the assets of the debtor that secures the Crown’s claim)
?	OR statute may say nothing about priorities and say the Crown just has a charge or security interest ? Then up to the court to solve it
?	The other way is a deemed trust
?	Statutory creation of a deemed trust
?	The statute basically deems a trust to exist in favour of a Crown
-	Statutes can do anything ? That’s outside of bankruptcy
-	Within bankruptcy, the Q in bankruptcy is what is that status of Crown claims in the bankruptcy proceeding?
?	S.67(2) and (3) ? Try to clarify law in relation to deemed trusts

Summary of Quartet
-	Provinces cannot priorities b/w creditors or change the scheme of distribution on bankruptcy under s.136(1) of the BA;
-	While provincial legislation may validly affect priorities in a non-bankruptcy situation, once bankruptcy has occurred section 136(1) of the Bankrupty Act determines the status and priority of the claims specifically dealt w/ in that section;
-	If the provinces could create their own priorities or affect priorities under the Bankruptcy Act this would invite a different scheme of distribution on bankruptcy from province to province, an unacceptable situation; and
-	The definition of terms such as “secured creditor”, if defined under the BA, must be interpreted in bankruptcy cases as defined by the federal Parliament, not the provincial legislatures ? Provinces cannot affect how such terms are defined for purposes of the Bankruptcy Act

Additional Principles in Husky
-	(5) in determining the relationship between provincial legislation and the Bairkruptcy Act, the form of the provincial interest created must not be allowed to triumph over its substance; The provinces are not entitled to do indirectly what they are prohibited from doing directly
-	(6) there need not be any provincial intention to intrude into the exclusive federal sphere of bankruptcy and to conflict with the order of priorities of the Bankruptcy Act in order to render the provincial law inapplicable. It is sufficient that the effect of provincial legislation is to do so

5. Treatment of Secured Creditors 
A. Introduction
-	One of the fundamental principles of Canadian bankruptcy law is that only the property of the bankrupt is made available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of the bankrupt ? A trustee in bankruptcy therefore has no right to confiscate the property of a third party, notwithstanding that it may be in the possession or control of the bankrupt
?	This principle applies even if the third party has only a limited proprietary right in the property, as opposed to full ownership of it
?	This explains the treatment of secured creditors in bankruptcy ? Secured creditors have a limited proprietary right in the debtor’s property, which gives them the right to enforce their claims against the collateral in the event of default
-	The proprietary right of a secured creditor is largely unaffected by a bankruptcy of the debtor ? Upon default, the secured creditor may enforce the security interest through seizure and sale of the property or through foreclosure of the security interest
?	A secured creditor thereby withdraws the asset from the bankruptcy estate 
?	If there is a surplus after the secured creditor and any subordinate interests are satisfied, it must be paid over to the trustee in bankruptcy
?	If there is a deficiency (the proceeds from the sale of the collateral are insufficient to satisfy the obligation secured), the secured creditor may prove for it as an ordinary unsecured creditor in the bankruptcy of the debtor
?	The trustee in bankruptcy has only a limited ability to interfere w/ the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security
-	There is an exception to the principle that the rights of a secured creditor are largely unaffected by a bankruptcy
?	Provincial law may provide that certain registration or perfection requirements must be satisfied in order for a security interest to have priority over a trustee in bankruptcy 
?	Provincial personal property security legislation provides that an unperfected security interest is subordinate to a trustee in bankruptcy
?	The SCC in Re Giffen upheld the constitutionality of these provisions
?	Provincial statutes governing real property do not contain equivalent provisions that subordinate are unregistered interest in land to a trustee in bankruptcy
?	A secured creditor is therefore able to enforce its security against the trustee in bankruptcy despite its failure to register its interest in a land titles or land registration system

B. Definition of Secured Creditor
-	The definition of secured creditor in BIA s.2 is of pre-Personal Property Security Act (PPSA) vintage and raises two important questions: 1) does it cover security interests not enumerated in the definition – for example, conditional sales and some types of equipment leases; and 2) does it include non-consensual security interests arising by operation of law and not by agreement?
?	So far as the first question is concerned, in R v Ford, Austin J assumed almost as a matter of course that the definition in s.2 includes conditional sales ? We believe he was right, not b/c the inclusion of conditional sales is implicit in the enumeration of security interests in the definition, but b/c serious practical difficulties would otherwise arise in applying the BIA provisions governing the enforcement of security interests
?	This question, however, is not clear-cut b/c there is a line of Canadian authorities that interpret a similar definition of “secured creditor” contained in the ITA as not encompassing a conditional sales contract or a finance lease that in substance secures payment of an obligation 
?	The answer to the second question is clearly “yes,” although there is surprisingly little authority that states this explicitly 
?	The reasons for this construction are that the definition of secured creditor is not confined to consensual claims, b/c it expressly covers liens, and that the term “charge” is wide enough to encompass non-consensual security interests created by statute 
?	A repairer who as a common law possessory lien therefore qualifies as a secured creditor, as would a person who is entitled to claim a statutory lien on goods pursuant to legislation such as the Repair and Storage Liens Act or the Garage Keepers’ Lien Act
-	A landlord’s distress for unpaid rent originally qualified as a secured claim, b/c it gave the landlord an interest akin to a lien on the goods ? However, in 1949, the Bankruptcy Act was changed
?	A landlord’s right to distrain for unpaid rent was taken away and the landlord was instead afforded the status of a preferred claimant 
?	Any property that had been seized under a distress for rent had to be turned over to the trustee, unless the process had been fully completed by payment to the landlord before the occurrence of the bankruptcy (ss.73(4) and 136(1)(f))
?	The courts have held that these changes indicated that Parliament intended that landlords were no longer to be treated as secured creditors in bankruptcy proceedings
-	Although provincial judgment enforcement law may provide that a writ or other judgment enforcement process creates a lien or charge on the property or confers on it the same priority as a secured creditor, this will not give the creditor the status of a secured creditor in a bankruptcy ? s.70(1) of the BIA provides that a bankruptcy order or assignment takes precedence over all judgment enforcement proceedings except those that have been completely executed by payment to the creditor
-	Although statutory liens and charges in favour of the Crown qualify as secured claims and give the Crown the status of a secured creditor, the Crown’s ability to assert such clams in a bankruptcy has been restricted by ss.87-88 of the BIA ? Notwithstanding that statutory deemed trusts have essentially the same function as statutory liens and charges, they are afforded different treatment under the BIA
?	A person who has the benefit of a statutory deemed trust is not regarded as a secured creditor under Canadian bankruptcy law
?	The Courts have treated the holder of the claim as a beneficiary of a trust
?	However, ss.67(2) and (3) of the BIA have greatly restricted the ability of the Crown to assert such claims in a bankruptcy

C. Enforcement of Security Interests
-	BIA s.69.3 establishes the basic principle that the general stay of proceedings consequent on the debtor’s bankruptcy does not apply to secured claims unless the court imposes a stay at the trustee’s request ? Even then the stay can only be of limited duration and is rarely granted in practice
?	However, there is an unresolved conflict in the case law whether a secured creditor may engage in self-help in repossessing the collateral or whether it must file a proof of claim and comply w/ the requirements in the BIA s.81
-	In addition to these provisions that apply only in bankruptcy proceedings, s.244 of the BIA limits the ability of a secured creditor to enforce the security 
?	The secured creditor must give the debtor a 10-day notice before enforcing a security on all or substantially all the inventory, accounts receivable, or other property of the debtor
?	This limitation applies outside the bankruptcy context as well, and frequently arises when a secured creditor appoints a privately appointed receiver
-	Assuming that the secured creditor has seized or realized the collateral after the debtor’s bankruptcy, BIA ss.127-130 then come into play to determine the trustee’s and secured creditor’s rights ? If there is a deficiency in the amount owing to the secured creditor after the collateral has been realized, s.127 allows the secured party to file a proof of claim for the balance
?	However, in the case of an individual debtor, any unpaid balance will be discharged upon the debtor’s discharge from bankruptcy under s.169 or 172 

R v Ford Credit Canada Limited ** Refer to 3.2
** Listing it again is intended to indicate that secured creditors’ rights can also be considered at this point

6. Crown Liens and Deemed Trust Claims (Pg. 383-390, 396-401)
6.1 Introduction
-	Should Crown claims have priority status in a debtor’s insolvency?
-	The standard argument in favour runs as follows:
?	“A debt owing to the Crown is a debt owing to the public at large and the inability to collect debts owing to the Crown will affect the ability of gov’t to function”: Ronald CC Cumming
?	Another way of stating the argument is to say that the Crown is a “non-adjusting creditor” in the debtor’s bankruptcy ? It is a non-adjusting creditor in the sense that, b/c the amount of its entitlement is set by statute, it cannot prospectively adjust its claim against any given debtor to account for the risk of the debtor’s insolvency: Lucien Arye Bebchuk & Jesse M Fried
?	Like involuntary creditors (tort claimants and the like), non-adjudicating creditors are not compensated for assuming the risk of the debtor’s insolvency ? Therefore, on boh efficiency and fairness grounds, their claims should be preferred to the claims of other creditors
-	The standard argument against Crown priority is that “the burden of tax left unpaid by the bankrupt should be divided among all the tax-paying public rather than being borne by the creditors, who have already suffered losses”: Canada, Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
-	Federal and provincial legislatures use a wide variety of measures to secure for Crown claims priority over other creditors, both inside and outside bankruptcy:
?	A wide range of legal techniques, such as expedited seizures, expedited garnishment and distress and third party liabilities have been developed to facilitate enforcement of Crown claims
?	Other devices such as liens, charges, security interests, deemed trusts and statutory subordination are used to give these claims the highest possible priority relative to other claims
-	The effectiveness of Crown priority claims outside a debtor’s bankruptcy or insolvency varies depending on the terms of the statute that governs the Crown’s claim 
?	For example, the statute may give the Crown a lien, charge, or security interest over assets of the debtor to secure payment of the Crown claim ? In that case, the statute may set out priority rules to apply where a third party claims a competing interest in the same collateral
?	Alternatively, the statute may say nothing about priorities ? If it says nothing, the courts will give priority on the basis of the first interest to come into existence 
?	If the statute does deal w/ the priorities question, there are all sorts of possible approaches
?	For example, it may provide that the Crown’s claim has priority over both earlier and later interests 
?	In some cases, the Crown’s claim is made subordinate to a purchase $ security interest
?	Instead of, or as well as, giving the Crown a lien, charge, or security interest, the statute may provide for a deemed trust in the Crown’s favour of assets under the debtor’s control
?	The statute may expressly or by implication limit the trust to the case where the subject property remains separate and identifiable in the debtor’s hands
?	Alternatively, it may assert a trust even if the subject property is no longer traceable
?	The statute may provide expressly for the latter case by saying that the trust extends to other property in the debtor’s hands of equivalent value ? If it does not, the trust is likely to fail for want of subject matter in cases where the debtor deals w/ the subject property so that it can no long be traced
?	If the statute does create a deemed trust over the debtor’s other property, it may set out priority rules to apply where a third party claims a prior competing interest
?	Alternatively, the statute may say nothing about priorities ? if the statute says nothing,a court is likely to say the holder of the competing interest has priority over the Crown’s trust claim on the ground that, in the absence of a clear indication of the legislature’s intention to the contrary, a statute should not be construed in a manner that could deprive third parties of their pre-existing property rights
-	In a quartet of cases decided in the 1980s, the SCC decided that provincial legislation could not be used to bypass the 136(1) ranking by converting Crown claims into lien claims
?	Prior to 1992, the BIA ranked Crown claims as preferred claims under s.136 (This is still behind secured claims)
?	Although one of the fundamental principles of bankruptcy law is the equal treatment of creditors, s.136 sets out a # of different claims that are entitled to be paid before ordinary unsecured creditors
-	Federal and provincial Crowns long felt that they deserved to be treated much better and rather than waiting for Parliament to revise the BIA, the federal and provincial gov’ts addressed the issue in the Excise Tax Act, the Employment Insurance Act, the Canada Pension Plan, and the workers’ compensation act by deeming deductions not remitted to the gov’t agencies to be held in trust for the Crown and creating a first lien on all the debtor’s assets ranking ahead of all other claims
-	In other cases, where no deductions or collections by the debtor was involved, the legislation created a super-priority lien in favour of the Crown  
-	The deemed trusts or deemed liens “were intended to rank in priority to the claims of secured creditors”
-	In the last of the four cases, BC v Henfrey Samson Belair Ltd, the court also held that a deemed trust created under the BC Social Service Tax Act in respect of sales tax collected by the bankrupt, but not remitted to the province, did not qualify as a trust under s.67(1) of the pre-1992 BIA
-	In 1995, the SCC added a 5th decision

6.2 Priority of Crown Claims
Husky Oil Operations Ltd v Minister of National Revenue
(ii) The Principles and Philosophy Embodied in the Quartet
-	What principles should be distilled from the quartet? ? It has been suggested that there are two possible interpretations of these decisions:
?	What is called a broader “bottom line” approach which posits that “any time provincial law affects the final result of a bankruptcy, the province is improperly attempting to alter the priorities of distribution”; 
?	And a narrower “jump the queue” approach to the effect that “the province cannot attempt to alter the position of a person within the scheme of distribution created by Parliament, vis-à-vis the other creditors who are claiming from the bankrupt’s estate”
-	The “bottom approach” is not the appropriate characterization of the quartet
-	However, even rejecting the simplistic “bottom line” approach, do not agree that the quartet stands for the sole proposition that the provinces cannot “jump the queue” 
-	In my opinion, the quartet embodies a consistent and general philosophy as to the purposes of the federal system of bankruptcy and its relation to provincial property arrangements ? That philosophy cannot be captured in the pithy but limited proposition that the provinces cannot “jump the queue”
-	The quartet is better stated as standing for a # of related propositions which are themselves part of a consistent philosophy ? In their lucid and thorough study of the quartet, Andrew J. Roman and M. Jasmine Sweatman state that the quartet stands for the following 4 propositions:
?	Provinces cannot create priorities b/w creditors or change the scheme of distribution on bankruptcy under s.136(1) of the BA;
?	While provincial legislation may validly affect priorities in a non-bankruptcy situation, once bankruptcy has occurred s.136(1) of the BA determines the status and priority of the claims specifically dealt w/ in that section;
?	If the provinces could create their own priorities or affect priorities under the BA this would invite a different scheme of distribution on bankruptcy from province to province, an unacceptable situation; and
?	The definition of terms such as “secured creditor”, if defined under the BA, must be interpreted in bankruptcy cases as defined by the federal Parliament, not the provincial legislatures ? Provinces cannot affect how such terms are defined for purposes of the Bankruptcy Act
-	The quartet is clearly not limited to provincial “laws which directly improve the priority of a claim” ? To quote Roman and Sweatman:
?	The reasoning in [the quartet] is not limited to trusts, nor to situations of colourable legislation attempting to give an artificial preference to government ? Rather, these rulings are broad enough to encompass any potential area of conflict b/w provincial power to legislate in the area of property and civil rights, and exclusive federal jurisdiction over bankruptcy and insolvency
?	The SCC’s quartet of decisions, although dealing w/ provincial statutory trusts which affected priorities in bankruptcy, has progressively and finally provided a definite ruling on the relationship b/w priorities under the BA and any other provincial statute which directly or indirectly affects priorities
?	The law, in our opinion, I settled by these four judgments of the SCC ? In all four cases the issues were not whether the provinces could directly and blatantly attempt to alter the scheme of interests of secured and other creditors under what is now s.136(1) of the BA; Rather, the issue was whether a province could indirectly influence priorities under the BA; even in this weaker version of influence, the SCC has held that the provinces could not
?	It is also incorrect to state that in all four cases the provinces attempted to redistribute or change priorities by explicitly elevating one of the lower ranked claims to a higher rank ? The provinces were not attempting specifically to target the bankruptcy situation but, rather, to create a general priority
-	As a result, the “jump the queue” or “directly improve bankruptcy priorities” approach captures only part of the reasoning of the quartet 
-	As Roman and Sweatman noted the provinces were not directly or intentionally attempting to influence bankruptcy priorities ? Rather, the provinces enacted laws of general application which sought to create a general priority not necessarily targeted to bankruptcy 
?	This Court, nevertheless ruled that such provincial laws were inapplicable in the event of bankruptcy
-	The “effect” which Roman and Sweatman speak of is the effect on bankruptcy priorities ? Consequently, clear conflict, that is an inconsistent or mutually exclusive result, which in this case entails a reordering of federal priorities, is necessary in order to declare a provincial law to be inapplicable in bankruptcy
-	Think it’s important to emphasize the importance of Roman and Sweatman’s proposition #3 ? While agree w/ Iacobucci J that complete standardization of the distribution of property in bankruptcies is not possible across Canada having regard to the diversity of provincial laws relating to property and civil rights, yet the value of a national bankruptcy system is confirmed by the placing of bankruptcy under exclusive federal jurisdiction ? As Professor Hogg has explained:
?	Debtors may move from one province to another, and may have property and creditors in more than one province
?	A national body of law is required to ensure that all of a debtor’s property is available to satisfy his debts, that all creditors are fairly treated, and that all are bound by any arrangements for the settlement of the debtor’s debts 
?	Indeed, w/o these assurances, lenders would be reluctant to extend credit to persons who could evade their obligations simply by removing themselves or their assets across a provincial boundary
-	The goal of maintaining a nationally homogeneous system of bankruptcy priorities has properly been a constant concern of this Court ? Were the situation otherwise “Canada [would] have a balkanized bankruptcy regime which [would] diminish the significance of the exclusivity of federal jurisdiction over bankruptcy and insolvency … Otherwise there could be a different scheme in every jurisdiction …”
?	This is a prospect which this Court has been acutely mindful of in the past, and its vigilance has ensured the continuing vitality of our nation’s bankruptcy legislation
?	In my view, its past vigilance commends itself to the present and, barring an amendment to s.91(21) of the CA, 1867, also to the future
-	In this regard, agree w/ Iacobucci that a bankruptcy priority is a category, and also that provincial law may result in the content of such categories being different from province to province ? However, provincial law does not and cannot define the content of bankruptcy priorities or categories w/o limitation
-	Indeed, crucial limitations is imposed by the order of priorities in the Bankruptcy Act itself ? Thus, while individual provinces can define and rank categories such as “secured creditor” and “trust” as they each have their own purposes, those provincial laws which enter into conflict w/ the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act are simply w/o application in bankruptcy 
-	Finally, I would observe that while in agreement with the above four propositions as embodying the reasoning of the quartet, in my view the list would be more complete with the addition of a fifth and sixth, as follows:
?	(5) in determining the relationship between provincial legislation and the Bairkruptcy Act, the form of the provincial interest created must not be allowed to triumph over its substance; The provinces are not entitled to do indirectly what they are prohibited from doing directly
?	(6) there need not be any provincial intention to intrude into the exclusive federal sphere of bankruptcy and to conflict with the order of priorities of the Bankruptcy Act in order to render the provincial law inapplicable. It is sufficient that the effect of provincial legislation is to do so

NOTES:
-	Crown claims are now dealt with by BIA ss 67 (2) and (3) (dealing with statutory deemed trusts) and by BIA ss 86-87 (dealing with statutory liens, charges, and security interests)
?	Section 136 (1) of the BIA was amended in 1992 to remove Crown claims from the list of preferred claimants ? The analysis in Husky Oil will therefore have no further application to Crown claims
?	The case nevertheless continues to be relevant in connection with provincial statutes that create deemed trusts, liens, charges, or security interests in favour of persons other than the Crown ? For example, provincial employment standards legislation creates statutory devices that create deemed trusts, liens, charges, or security interests in respect of unpaid employees
?	Although BIA 5 81. 3 now provides for a security in favour of unpaid employees to the extent of $2,000, the amount covered by the provincial devices are often higher ? E.g. Alberta Employment Standard Code creates a statutory security interest to secure unpaid wages to a maximum of $7,500; These statutory security interests are fully operative outside of bankruptcy, but are rendered ineffective in a bankruptcy because unpaid employees are afforded a preferred claimant status for their unpaid wages under 5 136(1)(d)
-	A secured creditor, which is subordinate to a Crown claim under provincial or non-bankruptcy federal law, is able to produce a “priority flip” or “inversion of priorities” by invoking the BIA ? In other words, the BIA provisions governing Crown claims in bankruptcy improves the position of other creditors relative to the Crown when the debtor becomes bankrupt
?	Rules that improve creditor A’s entitlement relative to creditor B’s inside bankruptcy are contrary to good bankruptcy policy
?	The reason is that they create an incentive for A to put the debtor into bankruptcy in order to obtain a priority advantage over B
?	The danger is that the debtor may end up in bankruptcy prematurely
?	Although this jay be in A’s individual interest, it will not be in the interest of the creditors as a group
?	Bankruptcy is likely to result in the dismantling of the debtor’s business
?	The interest of the creditors as a group lies in maximizing the returns from realization of the debtor’s assets
?	The debtor’s business may be worth more if it sold as a going concern rather than piecemeal
-	Processor Cuming assessed the impact of the quintet and the 1992 reforms 

















-	Professor Wood in Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law identifies 4 different situations where an inversion of priorities can arise 
?	The first occurs where a creditor is given a preferred creditor status under the BIA
?	The second situation is in respect of Crown claims that are secured by a lien or charge ? These are fully effective outside bankruptcy, and they are often given a superpriority over prior security interests; however, in bankruptcy, they are effective only if registered and, even if this is done, they are rendered subordinate to a prior security
?	The third situation involves statutory deemed trusts ? s.67(2) provides that a deemed trust in favour of the Crown is ineffective unless it would constitute a valid trust in the absence of the statutory provisions
?	The fourth situation arises when a secured creditor is subordinate to a writ or judgment held by an ordinary unsecured 
?	E.g. A writ creditor may have registered a writ of execution against the debtor’s land prior to the granting of a mortgage to a lender 
?	Under non-bankruptcy law, the writ has priority over the mortgage 
?	However, by invoking bankruptcy, the secured creditor will cause the writ to cease to have any effect

-	Professors Buckwold and Wood, above, argue that the current state of the law produces the possibility of regime shopping under which a creditor has a strong incentive to invoke the insolvency regime—bankruptcy, restructuring, or receivership—that gives it the best priority ranking
?	Courts have permitted the restructuring regimes to be used to effect a going-concern sale of the business
?	Thus, all three insolvency regimes can be used to effect a liquidation, yet the priorities that govern are often markedly different
?	In particular, Crown claims that are afforded a secured status and statutory deemed trusts are effective outside bankruptcy, but are limited by BIA 55 86-87, and by BIA s 67(2) when bankruptcy proceedings are commenced
?	ln Century Services Inc v Canada (Attorney General) Justice Deschamps commented that these differences in priorities can give rise to a “strange asymmetry" that “can only encourage statute shopping by secured creditors in cases such as this one where the debtor’s assets cannot satisfy both the secured creditors' and the Crown’s claims" ? She commented that “[g]iving a key player in any insolvency such skewed incentives can only undermine that statute’s remedial objectives and risk inviting the very social ills that it was enacted to avert“

C. Statutory Deemed Trusts (Pg. 396-401)
-	Although statutory deemed trusts are also created in an attempt to promote the ranking of certain kinds of claims, they do so through a different means ? Instead of creating a lien or charge on the debtor’s assets, they seek to create a trust in favour of the claimants
-	The legislation often contains an additional priority provision that gives the statutory deemed trust priority over the interests of a prior secured creditor

British Columbia v Henfrey Samson Belair Ltd
Issue:
-	Whether the statutory trust created by s.18 of the British Columbia Social Service Tax Act gives the province priority over other creditors under the Bankruptcy Act

Analysis:
-	The answer to this question lies in the construction of the relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and the Social Service Tax Act
-	In approaching this task, I take as my guide the following passage from Driedger, Construction of Statutes:
?	The decisions … indicate that the provisions of an enactment relevant to a particular case are to be read in the following way:
?	The Act as a whole is to be read in its entire context so as to ascertain the intention of Parliament (the law as expressly enacted by the words), the object of the Act (the ends sought to be achieved), and the scheme of the Act (the relation b/w the individual provisions of the Act)
?	The words of the individual provisions to be applied to the particular case under consideration are then to be read in their grammatical and ordinary sense in the light of the intention of Parliament embodied in the Act as a whole, the object of the Act and the scheme of the Act, and if they are clear and unambiguous and in harmony w/ that intention, object and scheme and w/ the general body of the law, that is the end
-	With these principles in mind, I turn to the construction of ss.47(a) [now s.67(1)(a)] and 107(i)(j) of the Bankruptcy Act
?	The Q which arises under s.47(a) of the Act concerns the meaning of the phrase “property held by the bankrupt in trust for any other person” ? Taking the words in their ordinary sense, they connote a situation where there is property which can be identified as being held in trust
?	That property is to be removed from other assets in the hands of the bankrupt before distribution under the Bankruptcy Act b/c, in equity, it belongs to another person
?	The intention of Parliament in enacting s.47(a), then, was to permit removal of property which can be specifically identified as not belonging to the bankrupt under general principles of trust law from the distribution scheme established by the Bankruptcy Act
?	S.107(1)(j), on the other hand, has been held to deal not w/ rights conferred by general law, but w/ the statutorily created claims of federal and provincial tax collectors
?	The purpose of s.107(1)(j) was discussed by this court in Re Bourgault:
?	There is no need to consider the scope of the expression “claims of the Crown”
?	It is quite clear that this applies to claims of provincial gov’ts for taxes and I think it is obvious that it does not include claims not secured by Her Majesty’s personal preference, but by a privilege which may be obtained by anyone under general rules of law, such as a vendor’s or a builder’s privilege
-	If ss.47(a) and 107(1)(f) are read in this way, no conflict arises b/w them
-	If a trust claim is established under general principles of law, then the property subject to the trust is removed from the general distribution by reason of s.47(a) ? Following the reasoning of Pigeon J in Rainville, such a claim would not fall under s.107(1)(j) b/c it is valid under genera principles of law and is not a claim secured by the Crown’s personal preference
-	This construction of ss.47(a) and 107(1)(j) of the Bankruptcy Act conforms w/ the principle that provinces cannot create priorities under the Bankruptcy Act by their own legislation, a principle affirmed by this court in Re Deloitte ? As Wilson J stated:
?	The issue in Re Bourgault and Re Black Forest was not whether a priority interest had been created under the relevant provincial legislation
?	It was whether provincial legislation, even if it did create a proprietary interest, could defeat the scheme of distribution under s.107(1) of the Bankruptcy Act
?	These cases held that it could not, that while the provincial legislation could validly secure debts on the property of the debtor in a non-bankruptcy situation, once bankruptcy occurred s.107(1) determined the status and priority of the claims specifically dealt w/ in the section
?	It was not open to the claimant in bankruptcy to say: By virtue of the applicable provincial legislation I am a secured creditor within the meaning of the opening words of s.107(1) of the Bankruptcy Act and therefore the priority accorded my claim under the relevant paragraph of s.107(1) does not apply to me
?	It cannot be supported as a matter of statutory interpretation of s.107(1) since, if the section were to be read this way, it would have the effect of permitting the provinces to determine priorities on a bankruptcy, a matter within exclusive federal jurisdiction
-	The same reasoning applies in the case at bar ? To interpret s.49(a) as applying not only to trusts as defined by general law, but to statutory trusts created by the provinces lacking the common law attributes of trusts, would be to permit the provinces to create their own priorities under the Bankruptcy Act and to invite a differential scheme of distribution on bankruptcy from province to province
?	Practical policy considerations also recommend this interpretation of the Bankruptcy Act
?	The difficulties of extending s.47(a) to cases where no specific property impressed w/ a trust can be identified are formidable and defy fairness and common sense 
?	Other difficulties would arise in the case of more than one claimant to the trust property ? The spectre is raised of a person who has a valid trust claim under the general principles of trust law to a specific piece of property, finding himself in competition w/ the Crown claiming a statutory trust in that and all the other property
?	Could the Crown’s general claim pre-empt the property interest of the claimant under trust law? Or would the claimant under trust law prevail? To admit such a possibility would be to run counter to the clear intention of Parliament in enacting the Bankruptcy Act of setting up a clear and orderly scheme for the distribution of the bankrupt’s assets
-	In summary, of the view that s.47(a) should be confined to trusts arising under general principles of law, while s.107(1)(j) should be confined to claims such as tax claims not established by general law but secured “by her Majesty’s personal preference” through legislation ? This conclusion is supported by the wording of the sections in question, by the jurisprudence of this court, and by the policy considerations which I have alluded
-	The provinces can define “trust” as they choose for matters within their own legislative competence, but they cannot dictate to Parliament how it should be defined for purposes of the Bankruptcy Act
-	The province has a trust interest and hence property in the tax funds so long as they can be identified or traced ? But once they lose that character, any common law or equitable property interest disappears
?	The province is left w/ a statutory deemed trust which does not give it the same property interest a common law trust would, supplemented by a lien and charge over all the bankruptcy’s property under s.18(2)

NOTES:
-	BIA s.67(2) provides that property of a bankrupt shall not be regarded as held in trust for the purposes of s.67(1)(a) unless it could be so regarded in the absence of statutory provision ? This provision governs when a statutory deemed trust is created in favour of the Crown
?	However, sometimes a statutory deemed trust is conferred on a person other than the Crown
-	There is both a narrow and a broad interpretation of the Henfrey decision:
?	The narrow view is that the decision must be restricted to cases where a province is attempting to use a statutory deemed trust to elevate a claim that is designated as a preferred claim under the BIA ? On this view, Henfrey would not apply in respect of a statutory deemed trust that is created in favour of an ordinary unsecured creditor; the claimant would therefore assert the trust in the bankruptcy
?	The broad view is that the court in henfrey intended to establish the general proposition that, in order to fall within BIA s.67(1)(a), every trust must satisfy the requirements of a trust under principles of trust law ? The Ontario CoA in Re Ivaco adopted this broad view and held that a statutory deemed trust in respect of unpaid pension contributions (which is not designated as a preferred claim under s.136(1) of the BIA) did not qualify as a trust under s.67(1)(a) of the BIA
-	S.222(3) of the ETA creates a deemed statutory trust in respect of unremitted GST ? In language and structure it is similar to ITA s.227(4.1)
?	It is imposed on all the property of the debtor as well as any property held by a secured creditor and has priority over all security interests
?	However, the ETA deemed trust does not fall within the exception in BIA s.67(3), and therefore is extinguished by bankruptcy unless a trust can be established in the absence of the statutory provision 
?	A secured creditor will therefore have a strong incentive to invoke bankruptcy proceedings if the debtor owes significant amounts of GST

CCAA and how it plays out in the courts
-	Real time litigation ? Hears all matters w/ respect to a file
-	All CCAA applications originate in the same way ? An initial order 
?	Initial order is made to a judge and it’s booked in advance 
-	The reason for the form orders is, this has been an evolving practice over the years
?	Initially Canada did not have the equivalent of Chapter 11 that’s in the states
?	The CCAA as a substitute for something like Chapter 11 originated in Ontario and Alberta 
-	S.43 ? Service
?	Why is this important? The Court has to know that everybody who potentially has an interest in this reorganization knows about the hearing b/c a fundamental principle is that ultimately it will be binding on all of the people who will have an interest in this reorganization ? Fundamental principle of fairness 
?	The obvious people that have to be served are the secured and unsecured creditors
?	In very special cases, these orders are sometimes obtained by what’s called ex-parte order
?	Why would someone come in and ask for an ex-parte order? 1) It’s a fight b/c secured creditor and the company; 2)
-	The Plan 
?	Asking the court to file a plan ? If approved, will be binding on everybody
-	In a CCAA, the company remains in possession of the assets ? Fundamental difference b/w the CCAA and the bankruptcy
-	6-8 Conduct of business during the reorganization
?	Can’t function unless it can continue to produce, sell goods, pay bills, well inevitably as part of that exercise, they’re going to incur additional debt 
-	Clause 13 is what the initial order is all about ? What clause 13 says is pending this reorganization, while the court is managing this restructuring, everyone is stayed from proceeding against the company
?	This stay is important to distinguish from the bankruptcy stay
?	The initial stay cannot be for more than 30 days 
?	During the stay period, no one is permitted to do things which might improve their position
-	Continuation and services ? Says to the creditors if you’re a supplier of goods, you have to continue to provide goods to the company subject to a very important caveat “No one shall be obligated to be provide goods or services unless they’re paid for it”
-	Monitor
?	The court needs eyes and ears as to what is happening
?	A monitor is appointed and monitors what management is doing and prepares on a periodic basis reports to the court  
-	Interim financing
?	If the company hasn’t been generating enough cash to meet its obligations, obviously it’s going to have to borrow more $
?	One of the things, what you often have to provide for, is interim financing ? Additional funds during the reorganization
?	If you’re a potential lender to a company that’s in reorganization, you’re not going to lend that company $ and be at the bottom of the scheme
?	What this permits is, it permits everybody to be prime ? You grant a priority to that particular creditor
?	Interesting aspect of this, the notion of creating security for an interim lender, it was never contemplated by the CCAA ? Judges, by their own volition, using the generation discretion of the CCAA, said doesn’t say they can’t do it and judges started granting priorities
?	Eventually, the federal gov’t amended the CCAA 
-	Explanatory notes in relation to the order ? Read
-	 The claims procedure
?	Who is going to be in charge? The monitor; The monitor will, based on the company’s records, send out a notice to everyone on the company’s records which says ‘the company owes you x dollars and its terms of payment is overdue, interest is at this rate blah blah … do you agree? If you don’t agree, there will be a procedure as to how these disputes will be resolved”
?	This notice will be supplemented by, generally, a notice in the newspaper just in case a company’s records may not be complete 
-	Claim procedure goes ahead and the company formulates a plan 
?	Then come to the court and say ‘we now have our plan and we want to send it out to our stakeholders, creditors, and the shareholders, and we want them to approve it’
?	So they ask the court to convene a meeting
?	Meeting Order ? Tells what is there to do
?	Where it is, when it’s going to occur, who is going to chair, who is going to vote, how voting is going to happen
?	One of the important things, b/c it’s a two-tiered test, b/c it has to be owed a certain $ amount and a certain # 
?	Who gets lumped w/ whom can be an important aspect of this order
-	In a bankruptcy, nobody tells the secured creidotrs, including the court, what they’re going to do ? In the CCAA, the secured creditors are bound and are stayed as well
-	Approval/Vesting order
?	A # of these do end up as liquidations and assets end up being sold and the company ends up being liquidated
?	One of the things any purchaser, b/c this is a reorganization and there are potential claims, purchasers want to know that they’re going to get a good valid title to the assets 
?	This is where the courts step in ? Approval and vesting applications: 1) A plan going forward and the court approves the plan and once the plan is approved, it is implemented; 2) There is a transfer of assets from the company that’s being reorganized to someone else ? Vesting order, the court tells the purchaser, you will get good valid title to the asset 
?	Would be impossible to sell assets without these orders as no rational purchaser would pay fair market value of an asset w/o such reassurance
?	Have there been problems? One of the problems that arises the approval order ? The notion of the claims procedure is you have been told by the company ‘these are the people we owe $ to’; on occasion, there are mistakes (some people who are owed $ aren’t on the list, etc.)
?	Approval orders are essentially telling the reorganized company and creditors and purchasers of assets that there are no claims against these assets 
-	Discharge order 
?	Everyone wants to know they’re not going to get sued
?	Want to leave the process ? Want assurance/order from the court saying ‘we behaved our selves and we did the best we could and we don’t want someone coming after us that we’re liable for certain things’
?	Must make sure that we’re not discharging these people from things that are inappropriate ? Make sure we’re not going too far into the discharge
-	Final order
?	Everybody can go home 
-	If plan is not approved, bankruptcy ensues
-	How many companies in CCAA are successful in succeeding in surviving? Proved to be very effective

Review
-	PPSA ? Built in s.136 of the BIA
-	Husky Oil ? Talks about provincial legislation and the bankruptcy act
?	Adds 2 principles
?	Issue: Has the right of setoff, under the Works Compensation Legislation, conflicted w/ s.136 of the BIA?
?	SC said there’s an operational conflict w/ the BIA ? “Not an intentional 
-	Note dissent in Husky
?	The right of setoff actually should be allowed b/c it’s not a direct improvement
?	This has not been followed
-	Quintet of cases that have happened for the SC to decide what is the status of provincial legislation
-	In 1992, Parliament said we need to do something about it ? Status of the Crown as preferred creditor is removed s.67 is clarified as to deemed trusts and what a trust recognized in bankruptcy law has to look like; s.86-87 is added to determine what priority Crown is given 
-	There are exceptions under s.67
?	(1) Property held in trust for someone else
?	(2) Unless there’s a valid trust that arise at common law, or in equity, there is no trust recognized under s.67 (trust on its own)
?	(3) However, if there is a deemed trust, even if it doesn’t meet the common law/equitable requirements, it will be recognized if it is under these specific statutes
-	Note how important a trust is ? Not only removes property from a bankrupt’s estate, also gives priority of this claim OVER secured creditors
?	Any unpaid deductions that should have gone under the ITA, etc. is entirely taken out of the estate and is given over
?	Secured creditors don’t have access to this
?	Essentially, giving federal gov’t a super priority  
-	Our current status of the law, under s.67, it can be traced to the decision in Sparrow ? In response to Sparrow, in 1998, Parliament amended the deemed trust provision
?	Conversation b/w SC and Parliament 
?	SC is saying Crown doesn’t get priority ? Parliament changes legislation and SC reacts to that
-	ITA s.227(4.1) The deemed trust provisions, basically, give the Crown absolute priority for any amount that is deducted or deemed to have been deducted from employee’s wages and not remitted
?	When the employer does NOT give the deductions to the government
?	This is not a trust, it is a deemed trust 
?	This kind of priority applies against the employee’s assets, proceeds of those assets, despite any security interest and despite any priority in law
?	This is outside of bankruptcy AND inside the bankruptcy (The Crown always has this priority)
-	First Vancouver 
?	Does the deemed trust apply to after acquired property of the tax debtor? YES (It’s clear that as property comes into possession of the tax debtor, it is caught by the trust and is subject to her majesty’s interest)
?	Does the deemed trust operate on property that has been sold by the debtor to third parties? Court said no
?	Once it’s sold for fair market value/ordinary course of business, the property cannot be clawed back from third parties 
-	Post 1992 ? Default position is they are given an unsecured creditor status unless they fall under 2 exceptions:
1.	If Crown wants to be secured creditor, it can’t deem itself to be a secured creditor – register a security interest 
2.	Where the Crown falls under exception under s.67
-	If you have a Crown claim that doesn’t fall under those exceptions, if it does not meet the trust conditions that are applicable under ordinary law, it’s not going to work and is not going to have a trust – only way it can get a trust is to fall under the exception or to have the trust arise under common law or equity 
-	No such thing as a floating charge anymore ? Now it’s just general security interests applying if you have such interest (Under PPSA)
-	The court has, in interpreting these claims, has made certain decisions that can be quite problematic
-	Schawb constructions
?	Crown argues lease are security interest and Crown has right to this property ? If these leases create security interest, that makes the equipment subject to such leases security interest and the Crown will have priority 
?	The leases are not a security interest and therefore they go back to the lessors and Crown does not have priority over them
?	This is a case 
-	What does the BIA tell us now? S.86
?	(1) Ranked as unsecured claims
?	(2) Exceptions
?	(3) Exceptions
-	s.87 ? Registration of Crown securities
?	(1) If you want security interest under this law, you have to do what everyone else has to do – register security interest 
?	(2) Priority of disputes ? Security interest only covers amount you are owed & if others registered first, that takes priority
-	If the Crown wants to register its own security interest, in practice, the Crown is going to be subordinate in many cases ? This is the case b/c if anyone that registers a security interest is going to register it when debtor is in good financial health 
?	Crown, on the other hand, is going to be registering at a time when the debtor has defaulted
?	This means it’s going to be subordinate to all other claims
?	Even though Crown is able to get security interest, it’s limited in that scope of the security interest b/c it’s not loaning anything and can register security interest once default has occurred 
?	As for the deemed trust provisions, that puts the Crown at the highest priority under the particular provisions 
-	S.86, 87 + 67 are the important sections
?	No longer has preferred status under s.136

Unpaid Suppliers
-	This section is also about the ranking of (other types of) creditors
-	This is a very controversial topic
-	Secured creditors > Preferred Creditors > Ordinary/Unsecured creditors > Postponed Creditors (Judges sometimes subordinate creditors b/c they acted badly – this is a thing in the states; or others that are related to the company)
-	Additionally, there is special treatment for these classes of claims:
?	Unpaid suppliers of goods
?	Unpaid employees
?	Unpaid pension contributions
?	Environmental claims
-	These claimants will take priority over everybody else, even secured creditors (But these are not secured creditors – they are unsecured creditors who are given special priority due to their positions)
-	If these guys get to come in and repossess property, means it’s taken out of the pool of the debtor’s assets
-	SUMMARY: BIA gives a person who supplies goods to a commercial buyer a right to repossess the goods within 30 days of delivery if the buyer is bankrupt in a receivership
?	Provided that goods are identifiable, in same state they were in when delivered, and they have not been resold
-	The protection of s.81.1 ranks above anyone else with regard to those goods ? Unpaid suppliers can come in an repossess those goods 
?	Even ahead of ITA deemed trust provisions 
-	SUPER priority
-	Again came in to effect in 1992 
-	Protection, though, may be somewhat illusory b/c requirements are quite strict

6.2 Priority of Crown Claims Cont.
The 1992 Reformed Approach to Crown Claims 
-	The status of Crown claims in bankruptcy was fundamentally altered in the 1992 amendments to the BIA
?	S.136(1)(h) and (j) were modified so that Crown claims and workers’ compensation claims that arose after Nov 30, 1992 were no longer afforded the status of a preferred claim in a bankruptcy
?	This means that the quartet of SCC decisions that culminated in Husky Oil were no longer applicable b/c there was no longer an operational conflict b/w BIA s.136 and the provincial legislation
-	S.86 and 87 were added to the BIA, and these provisions now govern the status of Crown claims 

Re Gillford Furniture Mart Ltd
Facts:
-	A bailiff, acting on the instructions of the Commissioner administering the Social Service Tax Act, seized the inventory of a struggling retailer in an effort to collect unpaid provincial sales taxes of $26,192.85
-	When the bailiff submitted a Proof of Claim pertaining to seizure costs of $15,256.26 to the retailer’s trustee in bankruptcy, the bailff claimed entitlement to a first charge for “the costs of distress,” pursuant to s.73(4) of the BIA
-	The trustee disallowed the claim, ruling that the bailiff’s charges are to be dealt w/ only as a preferred claim
-	The bailiff has appealed that decision
-	The TJ dismissed the bailiff’s appeal

Analysis:
-	It is clear s.127 reflects a basic premise of the Act, namely, the right of a secured creditor to realize on his security
-	This now brings me to the primary issue here, the construction of s.86 and s.87 of the Act in light of Mr. Butler’s contentions w/ respect to the effect of provincial legislation
-	The plain meaning of subs (1) of s.86 is clear: claims on behalf of the Crown in Right of either Canada or a Province rank as unsecured claims subject to subss (2) and (3)
?	The exceptions in subss (2) and (3) are to be construed consistently w/ the scope of s.86
-	Not concerned w/ the exceptions provided in subs (2)(a) of s.86; the security in question is not available to persons other than Her Majesty and its sole purpose is to create what I would call “after the fact” security
-	Clause (b) of subs (2) of s.86 is relevant ? The words “to the extent “which are found at the beginning of cl (b) imply the exception is qualified, something less than a complete reversal of the unsecured ranking provided in s.86(1)
-	The extent to which that ranking is to be varied is as follows: the words at the end of cl (b) – “if security is registered in accordance w/ that subsection” – is a condition precedent, the requirement of which are to be found in subs (1) of s.87
?	We go then to s.87(1) and from that it is clear that the registration in question must occur before the act of bankruptcy
?	That is sufficient, of course, to rule out the second writ of seizure and sale 
?	Then, going onto subs (2) of s.87 I refer to cl (b), which provides that the registration is valid “only” in respect of amounts owing to Her Majesty at the time of that registration
?	The emphatic “only” is exclusionary of other amounts ? This is made clear by the clause that follows which permits the addition of interests accrued subsequent to the time of registration
?	No other addition to the sum owing at the time of registration is recognized
-	Turning to the Act as a whole I am not persuaded s.127 requires us to read s.86 or s.87 in a strained fashion as would be the case if we recognized the bailiff’s costs which arise subsequent to registration are to be an exception to the general provision
-	S.86 and 87 deal w/ a particular problem and I see no reason why the general should govern the particular ? I do not think s.127 opens the door to a construction that flies in the face of the plain wording of s.86 and 87
-	S.72(1) of the Act does not assist Mr. Butler ? Indeed, would be inclined to the view that the construction he wishes to place on the provincial legislation in relation to the relevant federal legislation is in conflict w/ the Act but the constitutional issue is not before us
-	Do not consider the result is either absurd or in conflict w/ the general scheme of the Act ? If Parliament meant to provide for subsequent additions to the principal debt other than interest it would have done so
?	As it now stands, the effect is that only security to the extent to which public notice has been given is recognized 
-	The proposition that the bailiff’ costs fall under s.73(4) of the Act as costs of distress was not pressed ? In my view it would fail as under any definition the proceeding taken by the Commissioner was not a distress 

NOTES
-	Unlike some of the other priority rules of the BIA that apply to both bankruptcies and receiverships, ss.86 to 87 apply only in bankruptcy proceedings ? As a consequence, secured creditors will continue to have a strong incentive to put a debtor into bankruptcy if there are Crown claims that are afforded priority by statute over the claim of the secured creditor
-	The Bankruptcy and Insolvency General Rules provide that a “prescribed system of registration,” referred to in s.86(2), “is a system of registration of securities that is available to Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province and to any other creditor holding a security, and is open to the public for inspection or for the making of searches” ? The provincial personal property security registries are therefore used in respect of security in personal property, while the provincial land registry systems are used in connection w/ real property
-	The personal property registries provide a notice-filling system that permits a secured creditor to register a financing statement before a security agreement is entered into and a single registration may cover more than one security interest ? S.87(2) does not permit pre-registration of a Crown claim, and the registration of a Crown claim only covers obligations that are in existence at the time of the registration
-	Note that under BIA s.87(1), the Crown security must be registered before the “date of the initial bankruptcy event” ? This term is defined in s.2
?	In the case of an involuntary bankruptcy, it is the date that the application for a bankruptcy order is filed and not the date of the bankruptcy order
-	S.86(3) provides an exception in respect of the statutory garnishment remedy (also referred to as a “requirement to pay”) created by s.224(1.2) of the ITA ? This gives the CRA the right to intercept debts that are owed to the debtor by third parties 
?	The ITA provides that this remedy has priority over a prior secured creditor who has a security interest in the debtor’s accounts
?	The CRA therefore does not need to register in respect of its ITA garnishment remedy, is not subject to the BIA s.87(2)(a) subordination to prior perfected security interests, and the remedy can be enforced by the CRA following the bankruptcy
-	The ETA also contains a statutory garnishment remedy 
?	s.317(3) provides that upon giving notice to the person who owes $ to the debtor of the requirement to pay, “the amount of those moneys that is so required to be paid to the Receiver General shall, despite any security interest in those moneys, become the property of Her Majesty in right of Canada to the extent of that liability as assessed by the Minister”
?	In particular, BIA s.86(3) provides an exception for the ITA garnishment remedy only, not the ETA garnishment remedy
?	Courts have been called on to resolve priorities where the CRA has issued a requirement to pay on a third party, but the tax debtor subsequently goes into bankruptcy before these funds are paid 
?	BIA s.70(1) provides that bankruptcy proceedings take precedence “over all judicial or other attachments, garnishments, executions, or other process against the property of the bankrupt, except those that have been completely executed by payment to the creditor” 
?	In Toronto Dominion Bank, the court held that under ETA s.317(3) the debt that is being garnished becomes the property of the minister of revenue as soon as the person is notified of the requirement to pay
?	The Crown thus became the owner of the $s required to be paid before the bankruptcy occurred, and those moneys therefore did not constitute part of the tax debtor’s property to be dealt w/ in the BIA proceedings
?	However, if at the time of the bankruptcy proceedings the minister has not sent a requirement to pay to a person who owes $ to the tax debtor, the minister cannot thereafter invoke the statutory garnishment remedy under the ETA to recover GST (although it can invoke the ITA statutory garnishment remedy in respect of an income tax debt)
-	The statutory garnishment remedy under the ETA is different from the ordinary garnishment remedies of judgment enforcement creditors
?	The service of a garnishee summons on a garnishee (the person who owes an obligation to the judgment enforcement debtor) does not  give the garnishor ownership of the debt
?	The process is completed and the garnishor acquires an interest in the funds only upon the payment of the funds to the garnishor
?	As a result, the incomplete garnishment is ineffective and the $ must instead be paid to the trustee in bankruptcy
-	S.223 of the ITA contains another mechanism by which the minister of revenue can recover amounts that are payable
?	Under s.223(2), the minister can certify an amount that is payable 
?	Under s.223(3) this can be registered in the Federal Court, and when so registered it has the same effect as if it were a judgment
?	S.223(5) and (6) provide that a writ issued by the court in respect of this deemed judgment can be registered in the provincial land and personal property registries in the same manner as a writ or other judgment enforcement process of a judgment creditor, and has the same binding effect or creates the same lien or charge as a writ
?	These provisions merely give the minister the same status as an ordinary judgment enforcement creditor
?	However, ITA s.223(11.1) goes on to provide that if the minister’s certification is registered in accordance w/ BIA s.87 it is deemed “to be a claim that is secured by a security and that, subject to subsection 87(2) of the Act, ranks as a secured claim under that Act” ? This is very different from the treatment afforded to an ordinary judgment enforcement creditor
?	All of the provinces permit registration of a writ or other judgment enforcement process in the land registration systems ? Many, but not all, of the provinces permit registration of writs in the personal property registry system 
?	Registration of a writ or other judgment enforcement process will give the judgment enforcement creditor the same basic priority as a secured creditor in competitions w/ other claimants, but upon a bankruptcy the judgment creditor’s claim is nevertheless regarded as an unsecured claim
?	Under BIA s.70(1) the bankruptcy order or assignment takes precedence over all judgment enforcement process that has not been completely executed by payment to the creditor
?	The judgment enforcement creditor is therefore not afforded the status of a secured creditor in the bankruptcy

6.3 Deemed Trusts under the Income Tax Act
-	One of the most significant deemed trusts recognized by the BIA is the claim of the CRA arising under s.227(4.1) 0f the ITA ? The scope of the deemed trust is wide and it has been described as providing the CRA w/ a “superpriority”
-	First Vancouver Finance v MNR ? Iacobucci J offered the following justification for the deemed trust arising under the ITA:
?	The collection of source deductions has been recognized as “at the heart” of income tax collection in Canada 
?	Because of the importance of collecting source deductions, the legislation in question gives the Minister the vehicle of the deemed trust to recover employee tax deductions which employers ail to remit to the Minister 
?	It has also been noted that, in contrast to a tax debtor’s bank which is familiar w/ the tax debtor’s business and finances, the Minsiter does not have the same level of knowledge of the tax debtor or its creditors, and cannot structure its affairs w/ the tax debtor accordingly
?	Thus, as an “involuntary creditor,” the Minister must rely on its ability to collect source deductions under the ITA
?	For the above reasons, under the terms of the ITA, the Minister has been given special priority over other crediors to collect unremitted taxes
-	The justification for priority of gov’t tax claims has been debated widely
-	The claim that the Crown is an involuntary creditor is a contentious issue

Morgan, “Should the Sovereign Be Paid First: A Comparative International Analysis of the Priority for Tax Claims in Bakrutpcy”
-	Traditionally, there have been several justifications for the priority for tax claims
?	First, unlike the claims of private commercial creditors, tax claims are for the benefit of the entire community ? The prioirity protects the revenue base for the common good, and avoids shifting the burden of the debtor’s unpaid taxes to other taxpayers
?	Second, unlike private creditors, taxing authorities are involuntary creditors, unable to choose their debtor or obtain security for debt before extending credit ? The priority compensates for this disadvantage, giving the taxing authorities an opportunity to assess the amounts due and mobilize their collection remedies
?	Third, w/ regard to taxes for which the debtor acts as the gov’ts tax collector – such as sales tax, value added tax, or employee withholding tax – the argument is made that, if no priority or trust is imposed, the $ collected by the debtor will increase the estate for the benefit of unsecured creditors ? In these circumstances, the tax priority operates to prevent a windfall to generate unsecured creditors who have no fair claim to the collected funds
?	Fourth, some argue that if the taxing authorities are not reasonably secure they will be discouraged from negotiating payment terms w/ debtors, thus forcing premature and possibly unnecessary business failures
?	Finally, it can be argued that the priority is needed to effectuate an individual debtor’s discharge, where tax liabilities are made non-dischargeable in order to discourage tax evasion through bankruptcy ? Granting priority to those non-dischargeable tax debts supports the individual debtor’s rehabilitation, making it more likely that the tax claims will be paid in a personal bankruptcy and that the debtor will be left w/ fewer nondischargeable debts at the conclusion of the proceeding 
-	As new forms of taxation have been created and tax rates have increased, tax claims have consumed more and more of an insolvent debtor’s estate, leading to Qs about the tax priority
-	Critics of the priority reject the community interest argument, contending that the debt owed to the gov’t is unlikely to be significant in terms of total government receipts, whereas the loss to private creditors, including (1) the imposition of penalties and relatively high interest rates, (2) third party liability, and (3) collection procedures such as statutory lien and levy ? Furthermore, there is no general rule that involuntary creditors should receive priority – several other categories of involuntary creditors are not entitled to any kind of priority
-	Critics also argue that abolishing priority for tax claims will provide a greater incentive to the taxing authorities to collect taxes in a commercially reasonable manner, by removing reliance on an artificial ability to be paid ahead of other creditors ? These critics reject the argument that priority can be beneficial to the rehabilitation process and argue instead that any incentive to delay collection is counterproductive
?	According to this view, delaying collection compromises the uniform enforcement of the tax laws and constitutes a state subsidy, which undermines the disciplinary force of an effective insolvency law
?	Particularly in situations where the debtor is acting as tax collector, the taxing authorities have better information available about the debtor’s financial condition than general business creditors
?	The debtor is required to submit periodic returns in connection w/ payroll, value added taxes, sales taxes, and taxes withheld from employee wages, and the authorities receiving these returns are likely to know w/o delay when there is a delinquency
?	Allowing tax debts to accumulate under those circumstances can unfairly disadvantage other unsecured creditors who go on trading w/ the debtor not knowing that there is a tax delinquency

NOTES
-	Does the existence of the deemed trust have any impact on the Crown’s incentive to monitor for arrears? The gov’ts position on monitoring is contained in its policy document “Deemed Trust: A Responsible Application Policy”:
?	Since the Crown’s priority results from legislation that is binding on third parties, the CCRA is not obliged to monitor the person’s business, to issue forms or claims, or to register or publish notice of its priority rights
?	However, within the limits imposed by the ITA … provisions regarding confidentiality of information, every reasonable effort will be made to give third parties timely notice of any claims of deemed trust by the CCRA 
-	The CRA claims the “payroll withholding … [mechanism] generate[s] not only most of the funds required for the federal gov’ts own operations, but also the amounts redistributed through various social programs”
-	Secured creditors have long objected to the Crown’s attempt to override consensual security interests ? Ziegel notes that secured creditors object to the “unfairness and destabilizing effect of superpriority liens that undermine security agreements made in good faith by a secured creditor before the taxpayer was in default in its statutory obligation tor, at any rate, where the secured creditor was not privy to the default and had done nothing to encourage it”
?	In the face of the existence of the deemed trust, secured creditors have sought to convince the courts to give a narrow interpretation to the provisions
?	In some instances, secured creditors have been successful
?	However, such victories “are usually short-lived b/c the federal gov’t has often reacted quickly to reverse an unfavourable judicial construction by amending the ITA”
-	The original statutory deemed trust did not contain any provisions that dealt w/ the priority of the deemed trust as against secured creditors
?	In RBC v Sparrow Electric Corp, the SCC held that, in the absence of any legislative provision, priorities would be ordered on the basis of the first interest that came into existence
?	The ITA was subsequently amended by adding language that would give the deemed priority over competing security creditors
?	The Sparrow decision and the consequent 1998 amendments to the ITA were discussed by the SCC in First Vancouver Finance v MNR

First Vancouver Finance v MNR
-	In Sparrow Electric, both RBC and the Minister claimed an interest in the proceeds of inventory of the tax debtor
-	In characterizing the nature of the deemed trust provisions, Gonthier J stated at para 34 that, even if collateral was subject to a fixed charge at the time of a triggering event such as bankruptcy or liquidation, the deemed trust operated to attach the Minister’s interest to such collateral as long as it was not subject to the fixed charge at the time the source deductions were made
-	Royal Bank’s interest was characterized as a fixed and specific charge over the inventory of the tax debtor ? This had the effect of making the bank the legal owner of inventory as it came into possession of the tax debtor, subject to the debtor’s equitable right of redemption
-	The majority of the Court concluded that, since the inventory was subject to the bank’s security interest before the deductions giving rise to the deemed trust occurred, the bank’s interest attached to the inventory in priority to Her Majesty’s interest under the deemed trust ? However, in reaching this conclusion, the majority of the Court noted that Parliament was free to grant absolute priority to the deemed trust 
-	In response to Sparrow Electric, the deemed trust provisions were amended in 1998 to their current form
?	Most notably, the words “notwithstanding any security interest … in the amount so deducted, or withheld” were added to s.227(4)
?	As well, s.227(4.1) expanded the scope of the deemed trust to include “property held by any secured creditor … that but for a security interest … would be property of the person”
?	S.227(4.1) was also amended to remove reference to the triggering events of liquidation, bankruptcy, etc., instead deeming property of the tax debtor and of secured creditors would be held in trust “at any time an amount deemed by subsection (4) to be held by a person in trust for Her Majesty is not paid to Her Majesty in the manner and at the time provided under this Act”
?	Finally, s.227(4.1) now explicitly deems the trust to operate “form the time the amount was deducted or withheld”
-	It is apparent from these changes that the intent of Parliament when drafting ss. 227(4) and 227(4.1) was to grant priority to the deemed trust in respect of property that is also subject to a security interest regardless of when the security interest arose in relation to the time the source deductions were made or when the deemed trust takes effect
?	This is clear from the use of the words “notwithstanding any security interest” in both ss.227(4) and 227(4.1) 
?	In other words, Parliament has reacted to the interpretation of the deemed trust provisions in Sparrow Electric, and has amended the provisions to grant priority to the deemed trust in situations where the Minister and secured creditors of a tax debtor both claim an interest in the tax debtor’s property
-	Parliament has also amended the deemed trust provisions in regard to the timing of the trust ? Reference to events triggering operation of the deemed trust such as liquidation or bankruptcy have been removed
?	S.227(4.1) now states that the deemed trust begins to operate “at any time not paid to Her Majesty in the manner and at the time provided under this Act”
?	Thus, the deemed trust is now triggered at the moment a default in remitting source deductions occurs
?	Further, pursuant to s.227(4.1)(a), the trust is deemed to be in effect “from the time the amount was deducted or withheld” 
?	Thus, while a default in remitting source deductions triggers the operation of the trust, the trust is deemed to have been in existence retroactively to the time the source deductions were made 
-	It is evident from these changes that Parliament has made a concerted effort to broaden and strengthen the deemed trust in order to facilitate the collection efforts of the Minister

NOTES
-	In First Vancouver, the court considered whether after-acquired property – that is, property that came into the tax debtor’s hands after the deemed trust arose – was subject to the trust ? In addition, the court also considered whether the sale of trust property releases property from the trust 
?	The court held that the “trust arises the moment the tax debtor fails to remit source deductions by the specified due date, but is deemed to have been in existence from the moment the deductions were made … Thus, at any given point in time, whatever property then belonging to the tax debtor is subject to the deemed trust”
?	The court also held that property that is sold is released from the trust ? However, the proceeds of the sale are “captured by the trust”
-	The deemed trust is subject to the right of an unpaid supplier to repossess goods (s.81.1) and the special rights of farmers, fishermen, and aquaculturalists (s.81.2)
-	S.227(4.2) of the ITA excludes certain limited prescribed security interest sand thus provides further limited exceptions to the deemed trust 
?	S.2201 of the Income Tax Regulations says that a mortgage on land or a building that was voluntarily given and “registered pursuant to the appropriate land registration system before the time the amount is deemed to be held in trust by the person” is a prescribed security interest 
?	Such a specified security interest will take priority over the deemed trust
?	However, where such a secured creditor has security interests over other forms of property, the value of those other interests will be taken into account in assessing the secured creditor’s position vis-à-vis the Crown (s.2201(2) of the ITR)
-	Secured creditors have sought to convince the courts to take a narrow interpretation of the deemed trust ? A relevant interpretive issue is the definition of “security interest”
?	As the deemed trust takes priority over secured creditors, the scope of such priority will turn on how the court interprets that term as defined in s.224(1.3) of the ITA
Canada (Deputy Attorney General) v Schwab Construction Ltd
Facts:
-	The Federal Gov’t appeals a decision out of Queen’s Bench chambers dismissing its application to have a receiver appointed for the purpose of collecting and disposing of the assets of the bankrupt 
-	The respondents’ position below and on appeal is they do not have secured interests as defined in s.224 of the ITA as leases do not come within such definition

Analysis:
-	I am of the view that the chambers judge was correct 
-	The equipment covered by the lease was not the property of the bankrupt and the leases was not “a security interest” within the meeting of s.224(1.3) of the Act 
?	As the chambers judge stated, “to decide otherwise would allow the applicant to claim as part of its deemed trust property not owned by the bankrupt but owned by an innocent third party who had just agreed to allow the bankrupt to use its property for a certain price pursuant to the terms of a lease agreement”
?	She correctly found that finding the Crown had a priority interest would offend the principle as set out in RBC v Sparrow:
?	This provision does not permit Her Majesty to attach Her beneficial interest to property which, at the time of liquidation, assignment, receivership or bankruptcy, in law belongs to a party other than the tax debtor 
?	S.227(4) and (5) are manifestly directed towards the property of the tax debtor, and it would be contrary to well-established authority to stretch the interpretation of s.227(5) to permit the expropriation of the property of third parties who are not specifically mentioned in the statute
?	I might add he went on to refer to the presumption against expropriation of property where he quoted Twaddle JA in Re Pembina on the Red Development Corp. Ltd. v Triman Industries Ltd.: “It is a long-established principle of law that, in the absence of clear language contrary, a tax on one person cannot be collected out of property belonging to another”
-	The appeal must therefore be dismissed w/ costs

NOTES
-	In DaimlerChrysler Financial Services (debis) Canada v Mega Pets Ltd, the court also considered the definition of “security interest” under the ITA
?	The court held that the interest under a conditional sales agreement does not create a security interest as defined under the ITA
?	Ziegel argues that Newbury JA in DaimlerChrysler was too quick to reject the relevance of the BC PPSA as an aid in construing s.224(1.3) ? Further, he argues that the wording of s.224(1.3) illustrates that Parliament intended “security interest” to have the same meaning as under provincial personal property security acts 
-	S.2 of the BIA defines a security creditor as “a person holding a mortgage, hypothec, pledge, charge or lien on or against the property of the debtor or any part of that property as security for a debt due or accruing due to the person from the debtor”
?	Compare this definition w/ the definition of “secured creditor” contained in the ITA
?	If the interest of a lessor under a finance lease or the interest of a seller under a conditional sales agreement does not constitute a mortgage, lien, pledge, or charge for the purposes of the ITA definition, would it not follow that it also would not constitute a mortgage, lien, pledge, or charge for the purposes of the BIA definition?
?	The easiest solution would be to amend the BIA definition to ensure that all security interests, including leases and conditional sales agreements, that secure payment or performance of an obligation are covered 














7. Ranking of Creditors and Distribution of Proceeds
7.1 Introduction (Pg. 411-414)
The Bankruptcy Scheme of Distribution
-	From the creditors’ perspective, no bankruptcy topic is more controversial than the ranking of creditors’ claims in the distribution of the bankrupt’s estate – understandably so b/c the creditors are fighting over their share in what is almost invariably a seriously depleted estate 
-	Under the BIA, creditors’ claims are ranked in the following order:
?	Secured creditors’ claims (s.136(1); see also s.71),
?	Preferred creditors (s.136(1)),
?	Ordinary unsecured creditors (s.141), and
?	Postponed creditors (ss. 137-140.1)
-	Technically speaking, secured creditors do not share in the proceeds of the estate at all b/c they are entitled to withdraw the secured assets from the estate pursuant to s.69.3(2) and to realize the assets themselves ? This is why s.71 provides that the debtor’s property passes to the trustee “subject to … the rights of secured creditors” and why s.136(1) provides that “subject to the rights of secured creditors, the proceeds realized from the property of the estate bankrupt shall be applied in priority of payment as follows”
-	Further, the distribution scheme must take into account the important concept of property ? s.136 only purports to distribute “the proceeds realized from the property of a bankrupt”
?	Thus, property held on trust by the debtor or deemed to have been held on trust (where the BIA recognizes such a deemed trust) is not available to the trustee for distribution (s.67 BIA)
-	In addition to these 4 classes of creditors, the BIA affords special treatment to the following classes of claims:
?	Claims of unpaid suppliers of goods (ss.81.1 and 81.2)
?	Claims of unpaid employees (s.81.3)
?	Claims for unpaid pension contribution (s.81.5), and
?	Environmental claims (s.14.06(7))
-	These claimants are given either a charge on the assets of the debtor or a right to repossess certain identifiable property ? In either case, the claimant generally obtains priority over other claimants
?	These claims are different from ordinary secured claims 
?	In the case of ordinary secured claims, the BIA does not create the security interest or charge, but simply recognizes the secured status created by some other body of provincial or federal law 
?	The special claims listed above are different in that the BIA creates a special status for such claims that otherwise would not exist
?	These special claims are examined first, b/c they allow the claimant to withdraw the asset or its value from the bankrupt estate thereby leaving less for the other claimants 
?	This is followed by an examination of the bankruptcy scheme of distribution, which establishes the ranking of the claims in respect of the residue of the bankrupt estate

7.2 Unpaid Suppliers
Ziegel, “New and Old Challenges in Approaching Phase Three Amendments to Canada’s Commercial Insolvency Laws”
a) Introduction
-	On paper at least, unpaid suppliers won a substantial victory in the 1992 amendments and there is every indication that the industry is ready to resume the battle at the next round of Parliamentary hearings
-	How do we explain this surprising denouement?
?	The recession of the 1980s and early 90s hit the Canadian retail industry particularly hard ? Dozens of retail chains and many large department stores were forced to close or had to be radically restructured
?	Second, much of the soft and hard goods retail trade is seasonal in character ? Suppliers may ship a large quantity of goods in a 30-day period representing a significant proportion of sales for the whole year
?	Suppliers who also complained that frequently when a retailer became bankrupt they suffered serious losses 
?	This was b/c the old Bankruptcy Act provisions encouraged retailers to “juice up” their inventory for the benefit of secured creditors so as to reduce the directors’ liabilities under personal guarantees given to inventory financiers 
?	A third factor is that many suppliers, especially in the garment trade, are privately owned and do not have sophisticated credit systems ? Even if they did, it would not do them much good
?	Small suppliers do not have leverage over large buyers
?	They cannot force them to hand over balance sheets or disclose their current financials 
?	Similarly, we are told, for the most part retailers categorically refuse to give buyers a purchase money security interest b/c that would jeopardize the retailers’ line of credit w/ their banks 
-	Given these and other arguments, the suppliers argued in 1991 that they should have a right to claim their goods on the buyer’s insolvency similar to the right enjoyed by suppliers under the Quebec Civil Code

b) 1992 Amendments
-	Of course, there is another side to the debate
-	The Colter Committee was completely opposed to giving unpaid suppliers a special status in the ranking of a debtor’s creditors, as was the banking community ? Apart from issues of fairness among unsecured creditors, they argued that giving unpaid suppliers repossessory rights on bankruptcy would seriously disrupt banking lines of credit and throw a major wrench in the prospects for successful restructuring of struggling retailers 
-	The House of Commons Standing Committee was more sympathetic to the suppliers’ pleas and responded w/ two additions to the 1992 amendments:
?	S.81.1 confers rights on unpaid suppliers of goods to reclaim goods supplied to a debtor within 30 days preceding the bankruptcy providing the goods have not been resold and can still be identified, and provided a large # of other conditions are satisfied
?	S.81.2 applies only to farmers, fishermen and aquaculturists and treats their claims differently ? They are given the benefit of a first lien on all inventory held by the debtor at the time of bankruptcy for goods supplied during the 30-day pre-bankruptcy period

NOTES
-	The Alberta CoA in RBC v Stereo People of Canada Ltd considered the purpose of s.81.1:
?	The intention of Parliament in enacting this section is clear ? Parliament intended to grant to suppliers who have recently delivered goods, limited relief from the inequities imposed upon them in the earlier legislation
?	These inequities include the complete loss of all unpaid goods shipped by the supplier to the bankrupt, leaving the suppliers subject to the risk that a debtor will order goods just prior to bankruptcy to improve his position in the bankruptcy
?	Re Rizzo Shoes:
?	The repossession section was included in the 1992 amendment of the BIA to protect “recent” unsecured creditors, especially in those situations where the bankrupt has “bulked up” w/ inventory to liquidate so as to generate funds to pay third parties
?	The protection accorded to suppliers is strictly limited to goods recently supplied which have not been paid for, which have not been resold, and which are in the same state as they were on delivery ? Parliament ensured that rights of innocent third parties who obtained an interest in the goods subsequent to delivery would not be affected
?	We see no inequity to the secured creditor who is not given recourse against inventory, the cost of which has not been paid by the bankrupt
-	Notwithstanding the special right of repossession granted by s.81.1, Professor Ziegel concludes that unpaid suppliers “won a largely symbolic victory; The number of successful unpaid suppliers’ claims under the new legislation appears to be very small”

Fountain Tire Corp. v Grant Thornton Ltd. 
Facts:
-	Application by the creditor for compensation for supplied goods and non-possessory liens

Issues:
-	Whether s. 81.1 of the BIA enables FTC as an unsecured creditor of Sturgeon Timber Limited ("STL") to reclaim goods supplied by FTC to STL, and
-	Whether s. 23(1) of the  Repair and Storage Liens Act enables FTC to claim non-possessory liens for goods and services supplied by FTC to STL.

(A) Thirty Day Goods Claims
Date of Demand
-	If the letter of March 13, 2006, is held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of s. 81.1(1)(a), namely, "a written demand ... in the prescribed form," then the goods described in the invoices would fall within the requisite 30 day period
-	In  Rizzo Shoes (1989) Ltd., Re, the supplier of goods to the bankrupt company delivered the goods on April 15
?	The supplier did not find out about the bankruptcy until they were informed on May 16, the last day for service of the demand, that the company had filed an assignment that day
?	On May 20, the supplier sent a letter to the trustee in bankruptcy setting out the details of the April 15 shipment
?	The trustee rejected the letter as not being in the prescribed form
?	The prescribed form demand was sent on May 31, 15 days after the last day under s. 81.1 for service of the demand
?	Farley J. referred to Bankruptcy Rule 3(1) 
-	Rule 3(1) is no longer in force ? However, FTC refers to s. 32 of the  Interpretation Act, Canada, which provides: Where a form is prescribed, deviations from that form, not offending the substance or calculated to mislead, do not invalidate the form used
-	It appears to me that s. 32 of the  Interpretation Act  and the former Rule 3(1) are similar in their intent — form is not to defeat substance
-	In this case, the letter of March 13, 2006, enclosing the relevant invoices, does not offend the substance of the prescribed form, and was not in any way calculated to mislead
?	As appears from the Affidavit of the Receiver filed in this proceeding, the Receiver was aware in his discussion on March 13, 2006 with the solicitor for FTC that FTC was seeking return of its goods pursuant to s. 81.1(1) of the BIA
?	By way of the letter of March 13, 2006, the Receiver had all the details of the claim which he would have had if Form 75 had been used
-	Farley J. held in Rizzo Shoes that in the particular circumstances of that case, where there was only one other creditor affected, there would be no injustice in extending the time so as to allow the supplier to have made its demands as it did under s. 81.1 ? Recourse in Rizzo Shoes was also had to s. 187(9) and s. 187(11) of the BIA, which provide:
?	 Formal defect not to invalidate proceedings — No proceeding in bankruptcy shall be invalidated by any formal defect or by any irregularity, unless the court before which an objection is made to the proceeding is of opinion that substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity and that the injustice cannot be remedied by any order of that court
?	Court may extend time — Where by this Act the time for doing any act or thing is limited, the court may extend the time either before or after the expiration thereof on such terms, if any, as it thinks fit to impose
-	I am of the view that there would be no injustice in this case to allow the letter of March 13, 2006 to stand in place of the prescribed form
-	The Receiver acknowledges that if the letter is deemed to satisfy the demand requirement of s. 81.1(1)(a), that the goods in question would fall within the 30 day period

Goods Not Identifiable
-	The Receiver submits that none of the FTC invoices identify which tires were placed on specific pieces of STL equipment and, further, that FTC has not provided any other particulars on how to identify what specific goods were supplied by FTC to which the 30 day goods claim applies
-	In  Stokes Building Supplies Ltd., Re, Mercer J. emphasized that the onus is on the supplier to establish on the balance of probabilities that the goods are identifiable ? He stated:
?	In considering the matter, I accept that identification under Section 81.1 need not be apparent on the face of the goods
?	In other words, one need not have serial numbers or other distinctive stamps on the face of the goods, although obviously that would be sufficient ? Identification can come from records such as invoices, purchase orders and from the evidence of representatives of suppliers and purchasers.
-	In Stokes Building Supplies the goods in question could not be identified from the invoices ? In the present case, the invoices have indicators which FTC uses to identify the tires and other goods supplied
-	FTC offered, through its solicitor, to send an employee to assist the Receiver in relating the goods to the invoices ? The Receiver did not take FTC up on its offer of assistance
?	I note that on April 5, 2006, 9 tires from the 30 day goods claim invoices were returned by the Receiver to FTC
?	The fact that FTC could not relate the remaining tires to specific pieces of STL equipment on which they may have been installed, while perhaps making identification more difficult, does not in itself mean that the tires could no longer be related to the invoices
-	In  Port Alice Specialty Cellulose Inc., Re the BC CoA noted the principle that in interpreting the BIA, the courts have held that it is a commercial statute used by business people and should not be given an overly narrow or legalistic approach
-	In  Thomson Consumer Electronics Canada Inc. v. Consumers Distributing Inc. (Receiver of) O'Connor J.A. for the Court observed, in obiter, that a narrow interpretation of s. 81.1 may be contrary to the intention of Parliament:
?	Further, I would observe that a narrow interpretation of the meaning of "possession" in s. 81.1 that excludes all third party possessions ignores the commercial reality that some purchasers and certainly some trustees and receivers will take possession of goods and arrange to have the goods held on their behalf by third party warehouses
?	While I agree with Farley J. that s. 81.1 is an exception to the general rule that unsecured creditors share equally in the bankrupt estate, an interpretation of the meaning of "possession" in s. 81.1 which excludes possession in these types of circumstances may unnecessarily restrict the rights that parliament intended to confer on unpaid supplies
-	While I agree that s. 81.1 does not confer a broad discretion on the court to make a general equitable adjustment between the parties, I am satisfied, if I interpret s. 81.1(1)(c) in accordance with the principles outlined above, that the goods delivered by FTC to STL are identifiable within the meaning of the BIA, in that FTC can relate the particular tires supplied to the invoices enclosed with the letter of March 13, 2006

Goods in the Same State as They Were On Delivery
-	The Receiver submits that any goods that were in use on any of STL's equipment at the time the demand was presented were in a different state than when delivered as they were worn or used
-	     There is no evidence before me as to which tires, if any, STL put on which equipment, or when ? There is also no evidence as to whether any equipment on which the tires were installed was operated, or for how long, and how much wear, if any was occasioned to the tires
-	Any equipment on which the tires were installed was sold by the Receiver
-	The Receiver has therefore put the determination of how much wear, if any, occurred, beyond the reach of FTC
-	     In  Barrington & Vokey Ltd., Re the supplier delivered goods to the bankrupt which were used in the construction of a hospital building
?	The bankrupt was the mechanical subcontractor on the project
?	Registrar Smith of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court — In Bankruptcy allowed the claim of the supplier under s. 81.1 and ordered that since the goods had been used in the construction of the building, the total value of the goods was to be paid by the general contractor to the supplier
?	Although the goods had been used in the construction of the building, this did not invalidate the claim under s. 81.1(1)(c)(iii)
-	In  Thomson Consumer Electronics Canada Inc. v. Consumers Distributing Inc. (Receiver of) Farley J. held that the removal of goods from bulk shrink wrap did not constitute a change of state, in that there had been no transformation of the goods or incorporation into other goods
-	In the present case there is no reasonable basis to conclude that in the 30 day period there was any marked change in the nature, form or appearance of the tires in question, even if they were installed on STL equipment and even if the equipment had been operated ? To find otherwise would, in my opinion, be inconsistent with the principles of interpretation of the BIA previously noted
-	     I therefore find that FTC has satisfied the requirements of s. 81.1(1) of the BIA with respect to its 30 day goods claim
-	The parties have agreed that if I so find then, in view of the fact that the goods have been sold by the Receiver, monetary compensation in the sum of $11,204.00 less credit of $3,834.12 for the 9 tires returned by the Receiver on April 5, 2006, is the appropriate remedy.
-	The net sum payable by the Receiver for the 30 day goods claim would be $7,370.34

March 21, 2018
Thomson Consumer Electronics Canada, Inc v Consumers Distributing Inc. (Receiver of)
-	S.81.1 provides an exception to the general policy of the BIA (a pari passu sharing amongst unsecured creditors) by giving a right to reclaim property to certain unsecured creditors (suppliers) of a bankrupt which is not available to the general body of unsecured creditors ? Thus the court is required to narrowly construe such an exception to the fundamental policy of the FIA 
-	It is an established canon of statutory interpretation that when legislation confers a right or benefit on persons which they would not have had at common law, the conditions which the legislation prescribes for the acquisition of that right or benefit are mandatory
-	Re Stokes Building Supplies Ltd:
?	Clearly, the onus is on the applicant to establish on the balance of probabilities that the goods are so identifiable 
?	In considering this matter, I accept that identification under s.81.1 need not be apparent on the face of the goods ? In other words, one need not have serial #s or other distinctive stamps on the face of the goods, although that obviously would be sufficient
?	Identification can come from records such as invoices, purchase orders and from the evidence of representatives of suppliers and purchasers 
?	To use an example if evidence establishes that Window Land had supplied stokes goods only within the preceding thirty days that would be identification although the goods might not be stamped, market or otherwise distinctive
-	Would agree that if applicants were shown to have supplied goods in the 30 day period and at the start of that period I was shown that there was a zero inventory of those goods, that would be sufficient identification ? However once one gets beyond that one is into very boggy ground
-	Would not seem that state of goods was changed by their being removed from bulk shrink wrap ? This would seem to be packing or packaging of the goods – and not a change to the goods themselves 
?	They apparently would be sold in their intended state as sold by the supplier – i.e.: in their original form (including perhaps individual boxing) 
?	Certainly there has been no transformation of the goods (or incorporation into other goods)

NOTES
-	On appeal, the Ontario CoA in Thomson dismissed the appeal on the ground that the supplier did not have a right of repossession under s.81.1 b/c neither the trustee in bankruptcy nor the receiver appointed by the secured creditors had possession of the goods ? The goods were in the possession of a warehousekeeper 
-	The fact that a third party had actual physical possession of the goods is not in itself sufficient to preclude the operation of s.81.1 ? If the third party is holding the goods as agent for the debtor and is bound to hand them over to the debtor on demand, the supplier’s right to repossess the goods is not affected b/c the third party holds possession of the goods on behalf of the debtor
-	The 2005-2007 amendments have reworded s.81.1 to provide that the right to repossess may be exercised if the supplier “delivered the goods to the purchaser or to the purchaser’s agent” 
-	The problem was that the warehousekeeper had two valid bases for retaining the goods, and was therefore entitled in law to refuse to deliver them to the trustee in bankruptcy 
?	The warehousekeeper had a possessory lien on the goods in respect of the storage charges ? Additionally, the debtor had given the warehousekeeper a security interest in the debtor’s goods stored in the warehouse

Port Alice Specialty Cellulose Inc (Bankruptcy) v ConocoPhillips Co
Issue:
-	Q is whether goods that are commingled w/ other goods are “identifiable” for the purposes of this statutory provision 

Held:
-	Am of opinion that the chambers judge adopted the proper approach to the interpretation of the statutory provision and the determination of how much oil Conoco was entitled to possess (Chambers judge determined that the respondent, ConocoPhillips Company, was entitled to recover fuel oil delivered to the pulp mill at Port Alice and not paid for, in spite of the fact that the fuel oil had been pumped into a storage tank in which there was a quantity of fuel oil remaining from previous deliveries)

Analysis:
-	A supplier which has delivered goods for which it has not been fully paid may demand repossession of them from a person who has become bankrupt, provided the goods are “identifiable,” pursuant to s.81.1 of the BIA
-	There is no dispute that the proper approach to the interpretation of s.81.1 is that described in EA Driedger’s Construction of Statutes:
?	Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously w/ the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament
-	This approach has been approved by the SCC in numerous cases ? The SC has also said that this approach is confirmed by s.12 of the Interpretation Act, which provides that every enactment “is deemed remedial, and shall be given such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects”
-	In interpreting the BIA, courts have noted that it is a commercial statute used by business people and should not be given an overly narrow or legalistic approach
-	The chambers judge properly applied these principles to the interpretation of s.81.1
-	Firstly, he noted that the words of s.81.1(1) did not exclude fungible goods such as fuel oil 
?	An interpretation of “identifiable” that would have the effect of excluding a class of goods would narrow the application of the section in a manner that would be inconsistent w/ the “grammatical and ordinary sense” of the words
-	As noted by the chambers judge, s.81.1 provides special protection for unpaid suppliers and its interpretation should be approached by applying the principles applicable to all statutory provisions 
-	S.81.2 does not assist the Trustee in narrowing the interpretation of s.81.1 ? It is not a complete code for the protection of suppliers of fungible goods 
?	It provides additional protection for some suppliers of such goods in the form of security over the inventory of a bankrupt, but the security is expressly subject to a supplier’s right to repossess goods under s.81.1 (s.81.2(1)) and it preserves the rights of farmers, fishers and agriculturalists under s.81.1 (ss.81.2(4) and (5))
-	The chambers judge determined that the intent of s.81.1, to protect unpaid suppliers, would be denial if it were not applicable to goods such as fuel oil in a tank ? He considered such a result to be unfair 
-	Do not quarrel w/ the Trustee’s submission that the effect of the BIA may be unfair in particular cases, but do not find his analysis of assistance in this case where the issue is whether commingled goods are excluded entirely from the protection of s.81.1 
?	In my opinion, there is nothing in the words of the section, in their context, read harmoniously w/ the scheme and object of the Act and the intention of Parliament, that leads to the conclusion that goods such as the fuel oil in this case are not capable of being identified, for the purposes of s.81.1, in the manner determined by the TJ
-	S.81.1 has been considered in 3 cases in other jurisdictions, where the courts have adopted a narrower interpretive approach, urged on the chambers judge and this Court by the Trustee
?	The chambers judge distinguished these cases, and they are not binding on this Court in any event 
?	In Stokes Building Supplies Ltd., the windows were not commingled in the way the New Oil was commingled w/ the Old Oil in this case ? It was possible to physically identify them, w/ serial #s or other markings, as it is the case for electronic goods such as DVD players or computers, referred to by the Trustee as also being “fungible goods”
?	In Everfresh, Farley J’s comment about whether the orange juice could be identified if it was not delivered to a clean vat was clearly obiter 
?	And in Tompson, O’Connor JA for the Court observed, in obiter, that a narrow interpretation of s.81.1 may be contrary to the intention of Parliament:
?	I would observe that a narrow interpretation of the meaning of “possession” in s.81.1 that excludes all third party possessions ignores the commercial reality that some purchasers and certainly some trustees and receivers will take possession of goods and arrange to have the goods held on their behalf by third party warehouses 
?	While I agree w/ Farley J that s.81.1 is an exception to the general rule that unsecured creditors share equally in the bankrupt estate, an interpretation of the meaning of “possession” in s.81.1 which excludes possession in these types of circumstances may unnecessarily restrict the right that parliament intended to confer on unpaid suppliers
-	Chambers judge properly interpreted s.81.1 of the BIA

The Cross-Appeal
-	The chambers judge concluded that Conoco should be allowed to repossess a pro rata share of the oil in the storage tank: that is, the proportion that the New Oil was to the total oil in the tank before any was drawn down ? He rejected Conoco’s argument that the “first in, first out” principle should be applied to determine Conoco’s share, stating that it “did not reflect the operational or process reality of how fuel is drawn from the Tank”, which is “uniformly”
-	Conoco cross-appealed, claiming that the application of the FIFO principle would be consistent w/ a liberal approach to the interpretation of s.81.1 to allow an unpaid supplier in its circumstances to recover goods for which it is unpaid
-	The FIFO principle was discussed extensively, in context of a dispute over moneys commingled in a trust account, in Ontario v Greymac Credit Corp
?	It was decided that it was not appropriately applied where the dispute was not b/w a debtor and creditor but among competing equal claimants to a trust fund
-	Conoco distinguishes Greymac on the basis that in this case there are no competing claimants for the fuel oil
-	In my view, there is an overly simplistic view of this case ? Conoco, as an unsecured creditor, competes w/ the other unsecured creditors for a pro rata share of the property of the bankrupt of Port Alice
?	Conoco has not offered any principled reason why FIFO is more appropriate than the pro rata method chosen by the chambers judge to balance the rights of Conoco and the other unsecured creditors, in the circumstances of this case 

NOTES
-	Following involves identifying the location of a thing, usually as it passes from one person to another 
?	The inquiry is usually a simple factual inquiry, but it can be complicated if the property is mixed w/ similar property owned by others
?	The principles that are used to follow goods into mixtures are similar to the principles of tracing
?	The difference b/w following and tracing is that, in the former, the goods have lost their identity by virtue of being mixed w/ similar goods
?	Tracing involves a substitution – an assertion that the claimant’s property was used to acquire some other asset ? This allows the claimant to claim the new asset 
?	Tracing principles were developed by courts to cover situations where the traceable proceeds were mixed w/ property belonging to other persons
-	A’s goods may be mixed w/ B’s goods ? If some of the goods comprising the mixture are subsequently withdrawn, it must be determined whether they were A’s goods, B’s goods, or some of each that were withdrawn
?	Courts have held that if a person mixes his or her property w/ that of another person and then withdraws some of the mixture, that person is presumed to withdraw his/her own property first
?	If the goods of two innocent parties are mixed together, this principle cannot be applied ? Instead, a pro rata depletion rule is applied
?	This approach was taken by the court in Port Alice 
?	One commentator who has questioned whether the court was correct in applying a pro rata depletion rule has suggested that the court ought to have applied the principle that subsequent withdrawals are to come from the buyer’s portion of the mixture
-	The original version of s.81.1 provided that the right to repossess goods must be exercised within a period of 30 days after delivery of the goods to the purchaser ? This created difficulties for the supplier, b/c the time would often begin to run before the supplier had any knowledge of the bankruptcy of the purchaser 
?	The 2009 amendments changed this element of the provision
?	This right must now be exercised within a 15-day period after the purchaser becomes bankrupt and is exercisable against goods sold and delivered during the 30-day period preceding the bankruptcy 
-	In RA Warren Equipment Ltd v KPMG Inc., the court held that if the seller retains title to the goods there can be no sale for the purposes of s.81.1
-	A suppliers’ right to repossess will be defeated if the goods have been resold at arm’s length or are subject to any agreement for sale at arm’s length: ss.81.1(1)(c)(iv) and (v) 
-	81.1 v 81.2
?	The latter provision gives farmers, fishermen, and aquaculturalists a security on all of the purchaser’s inventory to secure unpaid claims in respect of products sold and delivered for use in the purchaser’s business where delivery has occurred in the 15-day period preceding the bankruptcy 
?	Note that a person who asserts a security under s.81.2 is subordinate to a supplier who is able to assert the s.81.1 repossessory right in respect of 30-day goods 

7.3 Preferred Creditors: An Introduction
-	Husky Oil Operations Ltd v Minister of National Revenue:
?	It has long been accepted that the first goal of ensuring an equitable distribution of a debtor’s assets is to be pursued in accordance w/ the federal system of bankruptcy priorities 
?	Parliament has created an equitable distribution wherein the general rule is that creditors are to rank equally, w/ claims provable in bankruptcy being paid rateably (s.141) 
?	The rule of creditor equality is subject to 10 classes of debt which are accorded priority in a stated order, the so-called list of “preferred” creditors (s.136) 
?	Lastly, the entire scheme of distribution is “subject to the rights of secured creditors” (s.136) which, as Professor Hoggs has noted, “enables secured creditors to realize their security as if there were no bankruptcy”

New Zealand Law Commission, Priority Debts in the Distribution of Insolvent Estates: An Advisory Report to the Ministry of Commerce
-	In our view, the purpose of insolvency law is to provide rules based on notions of fairness and justice, which can be applied in any given case to avoid inefficiencies which would result from an individualized resolution of claims within a bankruptcy or liquidation 
-	In an insolvency, it is axiomatic that loss will be suffered ? The issue is how the incidence of loss will be borne 
-	The granting of priority status to a creditor affects the incidence of loss as particular creditors may be paid in full while others receiver little or nothing 
-	Agree w/ Professor Goode that the fundamental principle of insolvency law is that of pari passu distribution, for creditors participating in the common pool in proportion to the size of their admitted claims 
-	Our starting point is that after payment of secured creditors, the proceeds of realization of property of an insolvent entity should be distributed pari passu to remaining creditors unless there are compelling reasons to justify giving preferential status to a particular debt 
-	We have endeavoured to articulate the policy factors which should be taken into account when determining whether compelling reasons exist to grant preferential status to any particular type of debt:
?	The balancing of private rights should generally be given precedence over public interest issues 
?	B/c insolvency law draws lines which determine which creditors suffer more loss than others, it is the competing rights of those creditors which should be given paramountcy
?	While certain types of priority may be considered desirable on public interest grounds, the issue is whether it is appropriate in the particular case for these matters to be taken into account for insolvency law purposes
?	Care should be taken to ensure that social imperatives that might be taken into account cannot be met more readily through social welfare or other legislation
?	The need to create incentives for creditors to manage credit efficiently ? The granting of preferential status to a class of debt may tend to reduce the incentive for a creditor to manage credit efficiently, as that creditor is more likely to receive payment from the realized asset of the insolvent
?	The cost of any laxity will be borne by other (unsecured) creditors 
-	In our view, having balanced the considerations to which we have just referred, it is necessary to stand back and make an objective judgment as to whether the proposed property:
?	Is one which can be justified by reference to principles of fairness and equity likely to command general public acceptance;
?	Intrudes unnecessarily upon the law as it otherwise affects property rights and securities; and
?	Provides encouragement for the effective administration of insolvencies or, at least, does not provide any disincentive to administer insolvent estates efficiently
-	While we have taken the view that, generally, the balancing or private rights should be given precedence over public interest issues, there will, no doubt, be occasions when community expectations demand that public interest considerations be given primacy ? In our view, it is entirely appropriate in a democracy for community expectations to be the value underpinning a priority, provided the grounds for the expectation are articulated clearly so that proper debate can take place as to whether priority status is the best way of achieving the policy goal

NOTES
-	In Principles and Guidelines for Effective Insolvency and Creditor Rights Systems, the World Bank adopted a similar view of preferred claims:
?	Principle 16(C) Following distributions to secured creditors and payments to claims related to costs and expenses of administration, proceeds available for distribution should be distributed pari passu to remaining creditors unless there are compelling reasons to justify giving preferential status to a particular debt ?Public interests should not be given precedence over private rights
?	The # of priority classes should be kept to a minimum 
-	Note that paras 136(1)(h) and (j) are effectively spent in their effect ? The preferred status is afforded to these claims only if the debtor went into bankruptcy before the prescribed date of 0 Nov 1992
-	One author suggests that pari passu has suffered a progressive erosion due to the ever-increasing proliferation of preferred debts ? In “The Distributional Question in Insolvency: Comparative Aspects” Jose M Garrido argues that this is a result of the political nature of priorities:
?	As priorities are granted by legislation, every pressure group tries to influence parliament in order to reach a better treatment for their creditors
?	The development of legislation is the consequence of the political structure among social groups, leading to a race for the top in the creditors’ graduation
?	The legislative power has sought to satisfy the demands for protection of very different categories of creditors: the legislature feels free to grant a preferential status, b/c new priorities do not suppress previous ones
?	Superimposition has become the rule in the field of priorities: legislation superimposes new preferential credits on old ones, so that old preferential credits are not eliminated, but displaced to a lower position in the graduation 
-	Does this statement apply to the Canadian context?

7.4 Wage Claims and Pensions
Kevin Davis & Jacob Ziegel, “Assessing the Economic Impact of a New Priority Scheme for Unpaid Wage Earners and Suppliers of Goods and Services”
-	It is sometimes said that wage earners are non-consensual creditors b/c there is no formal agreement for the extension of credit ? The characterization is incorrect b/c even the wage earner who is paid on an hourly basis gives credit for at least the hour before he/she is entitled to payment 
?	However, it may be true that b/c the employee does not anticipate non-payment the employee’s wages are unlikely to include a risk premium to offset the risk of the employer failing to pay wages b/c of insolvency 
?	Even if the employee appreciated the risk of non-payment it is unlikely that the typical employee, especially at a non-executive level, would bother to bargain for a risk premium or some form of protection against the risk of the employer becoming insolvent
-	Employers and secured creditors benefit from any failure on the part of wage earners to bargain for a risk premium ? This is b/c issuing secured debt allows employers to transfer bankruptcy-related risk from creditors who are granted security interests to the wage earners whose preferred claims will be subordinated to those of the secured creditors
?	This directly benefits the secured creditors and indirectly benefits the employer if the secured creditors provide credit on more favourable terms than they would if their claims did not have priority over those of other creditors
?	Meanwhile, the wage earners who are not compensated for bearing the additional risk of bankruptcy-related losses are prejudiced
?	This strikes many people as unfair
?	Allowing firms to shift bankruptcy-related risk to their employees w/o compensation is also potentially inefficient b/c it allows firms to avoid internalizing all of the costs associated w/ their operation
?	This is undesirable from a societal perspective as it may result in excessive resources being allocated to firms w/ a high risk of going bankrupt
-	Even if wage earners are able to bargain for compensation for bearing bankruptcy-related risk it may not be efficient for them to bear that risk ? This is b/c it can be argued that, relative to other creditors, wage earners are poor risk bearers, meaning that it is more costly to society for a typical wage earner to bear a given amount of bankruptcy risk than it is for another creditor to bear the same risk
?	There are 2 reasons why this may be the case 
?	First of all, other creditors may have the resources, knowledge and experience to monitor the employer’s financial condition and either reduce the amount of credit extended or bargain for a risk premium as the probability of bankruptcy increases ? By contrast, wage earners often have little information about their employer’s financial position and, unless they can readily obtain other employment, may find it impracticable either to cease extending credit to their employer or to bargain for an increase in wages as the employer’s financial position worsens 
?	A second consideration is that creditors other than wage earners may be in a better position either to diversify the risk of non-payment across a large # of debtors or to obtain some form of credit insurance ? Granting super-priority to the claims of wage earners is one way of relieving them of the need to bear the risk of losses associated /w the bankruptcy of their employer 

NOTES
-	Wage Earner Protection Program Act ? This legislation created an insurance scheme to protect unpaid employees where their employer has gone into bankruptcy or receivership 
?	Neither the employers nor the employees are required to make contributions into the program – the expenditures are funded out of the general revenue
?	However, the Crown is subrogated to the claims held by the employees (s.36)
?	In the present context, the right of subrogation allows the Crown to assert the employee’s right in respect f a claim for unpaid wages
-	The BIA was amended to give the employees a security to secure their unpaid wages to a maximum of $2,000 for each employee (BIA s.81.3)
?	The security covers current assets, which are defined as “cash and cash equivalents, including negotiable instruments and demand deposits – inventory or accounts receivables or the proceeds from the dealing w/ those assets”
?	The security ranks above any other security against the bankrupt’s estate, except for unpaid supplier’s rights provided for in BIA ss.81.1 and 81.2
-	There are a # of limitations on employee claims under the WEPPA
?	They are not covered to the extent that their claims exceed $3,000 or an amount equal to 4 times the maximum weekly insurable earnings under the Employment Insurance Act, whichever is greater
?	Nor are they covered to the extent that their wage claims fall outside the 5 month period preceding the bankruptcy 
?	Bill C-10, which implements the January 27, 2009 federal budget, changed the definition so that it now includes both severance and termination pay
?	Although Bill C-10 came into force on March 12, 2009, the amendment is made retroactive to January 27, 2009 ? An individual is ineligible to receive a payment in respect of wages earned during a period in which the individual was an officer or director or the employer; if he/she had a controlling interest in the employer; occupied a managerial position w/ the employer; or if he/she was not acting at arm’s length w/ such a person (s.6)
-	If the current assets are insufficient to satisfy the BIA s.81.3 security, the claimant can prove as a preferred creditor for the balance of the claim ? The superpriority that the s.81.3 security enjoys over other secured creditors afforded to this claim may mean that there will be insufficient current assets to satisfy the claims of the secured creditors
?	The secured creditors may prove as a preferred creditor in the bankruptcy of an employer for the amount that it loses by virtue of this superpriority
?	An employee who is not eligible under the WEPPA may prove the claim as an ordinary unsecured creditor in the bankruptcy of the employer
-	Provincial and federal employment standards legislation and business operations statutes give unpaid employees a right of recovery against a director of an employer corporation ? In many instances, the conditions for making such claims are less restrictive than under the WEPPA
?	E.g. The employment standards legislation in Ontario and Alberta provide that the right to recover against a director extends to all wages that becomes payable up to a maximum of 6 months ? How do the new wage protection provisions affect this right?
